# EUR: The City of Mussolini's Dreams

I know I shouldn't dare to say, but after visiting an ocean of ancient ruins and historical monuments in Rome, I was getting a little bit burned out about old Roman stuff. An simple quiestion came to my mind - the significance of ancient Roman architecture and city planning needs no reiterrating, but what are Rome's contemporary practices of urban developments look like?

As most of the twenty-first-century metropolis, Rome is also caught between two incompatible contending realities: the vigorousenergy of continuously expanding modern capital, and the inertia of ancient city centre that makes Rome one of the most poopular tourist destinations.

We've heard from a local urbanist that there is an interesting district to visit, away from ancient city centre and a crowd of tourists, which might help us understand at least a part of thier contradicting realities.

## EUR, a place developed to showcase twenty years of Fascism

We visited [EUR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR,_Rome), a district located in the south-west part of the city. EUR stands for Esposizione Universale Roma; it was originally planned in the 1930s as the site for the 1942 world's fair to showcase twenty years of Fascism in Italy. Yes, it was initiated by Benito Mussolini.

The world fair never happened and the distrist had left uncompleted though, due to the intervening of World War II. After the war, the site has been redeveloped as the basis of an out-of-town business district, and now, EUR functions as Rome's new city centre. The unfinished Fascist-era buildings were completed and other contemporary buildings were built during the 1950s and 1960s

## Modern city centre: how it looks today?

The district is well-connected from the historical downtown by metro, so it wasn't so hard to reach there. The district has a perfectly symmetrical shape - at the very centre there is a big boulevard from which neighrbohoods spread out to opposite direction. We started our walk from Parco Centrale del Lago and continued on the inner neghruohoods to visit Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana and other landmarks.

Although it doesn’t quite feel right to enjoy them, the district is full of Fascist-era architecture and urban design, which cleary take a reference from Romen classical and Renaissance style. The district has also been succesful to attract new housings, educational and government facilities to meet the need of ever-expanding modern capital.

We've noticed the uncomfortable number of cars, too. Some of the articles about EUR we found on Google boldly state that EUR is walkable. Let me tell you, it is NOT. Parco Centrale del Lago was hard to reach with all the car lanes without pedestrian traffic lights.

## Nazizm, new Italy and nostalgia

The design was inspired, according to the fascist ideology, by Roman Imperial town planning,[5] with modern elements which came from Italian rationalism, the result being a sort of simplified neoclassicism.
, built mainly of limestone, tuff and marble, traditional materials associated with Roman Empire architecture.

Museo della Civiltà Romana
the copies of Trajan’s Column bas relief panels which allow you to follow the story of the Roman Emperor’s Dacian Wars victories like a giant graphic novel (the original is located at Trajan’s Forum near Piazza Venezia), and an amazing 1:250 scale model of Imperial Rome,

the Palazzo dei Congressi
a modern interpretation of the Pantheon by architect Adalberto Libera.

Viale della Civiltà Lavoro to EUR’s highlight
the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Known as the Colesseo Quadrato (square coliseum), it is perhaps the most widely-known representation of Fascist architecture, with its particular kind of neo-classic style.

It’s no wonder that many Roman professionals and families make their home in the EUR – it’s accessible and full of modern amenities.
EUR is the headquarters of many companies and public bodies,

I couldn't really enjoy due to its unwalkability and 　 Awkward 　 nostalgia
It left me with a bit of bitter taste
