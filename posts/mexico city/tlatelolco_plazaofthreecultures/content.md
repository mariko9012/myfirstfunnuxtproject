# Plaza de las Tres Culturas, and the tragedies of Mexico City’s Tlatelolco housing complex

I watched [Temporada de patos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporada_de_patos), a 2004 Mexican film directed by Fernando Eimbcke. The movie depicts two ordinary fourteen years old kids who live in Tlatelolco housing complex in Mexico City, and thier "ordinary" yet adventuraous Sunday.

I was so hooked by the looks of the housing complex they live in - it turns out that this neighrohood is called The Conjunto Urbano Nonoalco Tlatelolco, and it is the largest apartment complex in Mexico, and second largest in North America.

Scene of the final brutal conquest of the Aztecs, the massacre of protesters ahead of the 1968 Olympic Games and the collapse of an entire housing block in the 1985 earthquake, Tlatelolco embodies Mexico’s painful history

It was built in the 1960s by architect Mario Pani. Originally, the complex had 102 apartment buildings, with its own schools, hospitals, stores and more, to make it a city within a city

1985 Mexico City earthquake. This quake caused the immediate collapse of the Nuevo León building with others being demolished in the months afterwards. Further earthquakes in 1993 caused the condemnation of more buildings. In addition to the lost buildings, many residents eventually undersold or abandoned their apartments, as repairs were either never made or made poorly.

The project was awarded to architect Mario Pani (along with Ricardo de Robina) at a time when Mexico and Mexico City was experiencing rapid economic expansion.[4][7][9] Born in 1911, Mario Pani was a Mexican architect who mostly grew up in Europe and obtained his degree in architecture from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1934.[10] After returning to Mexico, he became part of a movement to make Mexico, especially Mexico City, modern, post-Revolution and progressive. Pani’s work focused on major residential centers such as large apartment buildings and condominiums. Works like Nonoalco are classified as “supermanzanas” or “super (city) blocks.” His work changed the focus of urban housing from horizontal to vertical.

## Plaza de las Tres Culturas - Squre of three cultures

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the area was a train yard for the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México. The modern apartment complex was built over the then-abandoned train yard.[5] It surrounds [the Plaza de las Tres Culturas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_las_Tres_Culturas), a place that symbolizes the synthesis of Mexico’s pre-Hispanic and colonial pasts with the modern day.[6] This plaza contains the archeological site of Tlatelolco with its ceremonial center, the parish church of Santiago Tlatelolco and the modern buildings that surround them, including a building associated with the Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores.[3]

Quality of life in the area diminished after the Tlatelolco massacre on 2 October 1968, which occurred on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas.[7] The area’s only fire station closed during that year and police presence began to diminish, leading to rising crime.[11] The complex suffered damage from two small earthquakes in 1979.

Today a district of Mexico City, Tlatelolco began as a city-state on the shore of Lake Texcoco, eventually overtaken by the ascendant Aztecs, who made it a part of their empire. During the brutal conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés, in 1521 Tlatelolco was the site of the last battle between the Aztecs and the Spanish conquistadors. In the battle, Cortés triumphed, and some 40,000 Aztecs were killed.

The Spaniards did their best to pave over Tlatelolco’s dark history, demolishing its temple and using the stones to build a church. Much later, in the 1950s, Mexican leaders resolved to finally right the wrongs suffered on the site, putting it to good use by building a modern housing project there.

After the country gained independence in 1810, gradual industrialisation during the 19th century and the creation of a railway network laid the foundations for a steady population shift from rural to urban. By the 1950s, Mexico City was facing a serious housing shortage.

Seeking to address this issue, the Mexican government sought to implement the most innovative building design of the time. They contracted Mario Pani, a young architect who had become one of the biggest proponents of the modernist ideas of Le Corbusier in the country.

His plan called for 102 residential towers, ranging in height from four to 22 floors, placed in large blocks with plazas and public space in between – Le Corbusier’s “towers in the park” concept. Additionally, the area near the recently excavated ruins of the former Tlatelolco temple and the Spanish church would be converted into a plaza, named Plaza de las Tres Culturas (“Square of the Three Cultures”, after the Aztecs, Spain and Mexico).

Pani believed that the complex would be part of a “general process of regeneration”. Far from achieving these lofty goals, the complex instead set the stage for the next instalment in Tlatelolco’s tragic history.

in 19868
when protesters gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the late afternoon for a rally. a shot was fired. John Rodda, Olympic correspondent for The Guardian, witnessed the event and concluded 350 had been killed. Though the final body count remains unknown, photos surfaced in 2001 confirming key elements of Rodda’s testimony.

Two decades later, another tragedy would occur at the site
Two of the three segments of the Nuevo León building collapsed, killing all residents inside. On the morning of 9 September 1985, Mexico was hit by an 8.1 magnitude earthquake. The Tlatelolco complex was hit particularly hard, left between 200 and 300 dead.

Just as Pruitt-Igoe in St Louis, Missouri had demonstrated the “death of modernism” in the United States, the partial demolition of Tlatelolco showed it to be a failure south of the border as well.

Today, Tlatelolco seems to have put its tragic days in the past, but living conditions there remain far from perfect.

## Today

It occupies approximately 946,000 m2 [3] and remains as the largest vertical apartments complex in Mexico.[12] Currently 55,000 people live there with 40% being senior citizens and retired.[11]

The complex and surrounding neighborhoods such as Colonia Morelos, Atlampla, Colonia Guerrero, Tepito, Colonia Buenavista, and San Simon Tolonahuac and Colonia Peralvillo are all high crime areas, which makes the security a great problem to resolve.
