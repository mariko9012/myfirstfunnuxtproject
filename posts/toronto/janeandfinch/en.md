# Jane and Finch, Canada's most diverse neighborhood

> "Jane and Finch may not be the best-planned community. Blame the â€™crats who put pen to paper back in the 60s." - *[ENZO DIMATTEO](https://nowtoronto.com/news/9-things-we-love-about-jane-finch/), 9 things we love about Jane-Finch*

[Jane and Finch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_and_Finch#cite_note-NFB_1098_homefeeling-6) is a neighborhood located in the northwest end of Toronto, Ontario. The neighborhood is known as the most ethnoculturally diverse neighborhood in Canada, and it has often been stigmatized as a ghetto.  
A few months ago Minister Michael Tibollo visited the neighborhood and made comments which they believe "perpetuate negative stereotypes about the community"(see this [newsreport](https://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2018/07/18/jane-finch-residents-defend-neighbourhood-after-ministers-comments/)).

I am personally interested in culturally diverse neighborhoods in cities and how many of them suffer from spatial discrimination, stereotypes, and stigmatization. I couldn't take many pictures there, but if you are an urbanist, take a moment to visit Jane and Finch - it is not the best-planned neighborhood, but it has its charm. You can take a look at the inside of Jane and Finch mall, which is very vibrant. Other visitor information can be found here [Jane-Finch.com](http://www.jane-finch.com/).

Moreover, if you are serious about knowing more about this kind of diverse, multicultural communities and its challenges, I'd recommend watching a [documentary](https://www.nfb.ca/film/home_feeling_struggle_for_a_community/) about **Jane and Finch: Home Feeling: Struggle for a Community by Jennifer Hodge & Roger McTair**.

It is an urgent planning concern, too - In Toronto, there are some similar neighborhoods such as [Regent Park](https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/graduate/programs/ensciman/forms/RemoAgostino_RegentParkRevitalization_EnSciMan2013.pdf), which went through massive revitalization recently. What do these communities want and how can planners tackle the issue of spatial discrimination and stigmatization, without applying a top-down revitalization approach? Prof. Mohammed Abdul Qadeer from Queen University wrote [a book](https://www.amazon.ca/Multicultural-Cities-Toronto-York-Angeles/dp/1442630140) about Multicultural Planning. We can start visiting these neighborhoods instead of talking about them, and see the everyday life of local inhabitant.
