# Senjo, the cost of Japanese marginal villages

Abandoned houses slowly collapsing as conquered by vegetation, bamboo groves taking over the man-shaped woods, wild boars devastating the very lasts paddy fields and hordes of monkeys constantly raiding the precious tomato greenhouse of M. Ito, sixty-eight years old and youngest inhabitant of the area. At first, the village of Senjo might look like any Japanese [marginal village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genkai_sh%C5%ABraku) of the XXIth century.  

Located in the mountainous area of Saijo, in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, the village, however, presents rare singularities and a unique history. Established by descendants of the [Heike clan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2019/08/25/our-lives/island-festival-steeped-history/#.XkfzsCM9jIU) seeking refuge after their defeat at the battle of Dan-no-ura in the XIIth century, the village was originally composed of 2,500 stonewall terrace paddy fields erected five hundred years ago. Spreading over one thousand hectares, from which the name of the village 千町 originates, this manmade landscape might be the largest example of its kind in Japan. **Regardless of its uniqueness, the village remains largely unknown even to the very inhabitants of Saijo city located no more than 10 kilometers away as if the descendants of the exiled Heikei warriors were still hiding.**

## Cities, towns and villages are disappearing in Japan

Successive municipal merges and dissolutions from the Meiji (1867 to 1912) to the Heisei (1989 to 2019) eras and the collapse of mountain based industries in the second half of the XX century **have consecutively dragged the rural populations to new urban centers and gradually increased the isolation of rural communities lacking infrastructures and public facilities in a context of national rural depopulation and [aging society](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c0117.html), brutally left to nineteen the total population of a village** that counted more than a thousand souls not even fifty years ago.

According to the concept developed by the professor Akira Ohno of Nagano University the next and final stage of villages like Senjo is the category of shoumetsu shuraku or extinct village, defined by the total extinction of the village population.

Far from being an isolated case, the compilation of reports published by former minister and prefectural governor Hiroya Masuda  in 2014 _Local Extinctions_, prospects on **the extinction of 896 cities, towns and villages across the country by 2040**.

This national tendency leads to a tremendous amount of issues, not only for the very last inhabitants of rural communities but for the environment as well and consequentially urban centers too because of a complex interdependence that Senjo perfectly reflects.

## What does it mean for the environment

**Far from the fairy like scenario of a Hayo Miyazaki movie that could inspire the old scenery of the village, nature is not conveniently going to self-regenerate itself erasing the marks of mankind and the responsibilities that they imply.**

From the original 2,500 paddy fields, only 15 were still dedicated to the cultivation of rice in the last seeding season. Threatening the habitat of over [5000 species](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236970878_Ecosystem_services_by_paddy_fields_as_substitutes_of_natural_wetlands_in_Japan) that directly or indirectly rely on paddy fields and are now endangered by the loss of this manmade environment.

The post war secondary forests of cedars surrounding the village and meant to be logged decades ago are now depriving boars, monkeys and deers of their natural subsistence as the thick canopies of cedars forbid vital access to the sunlight needed by new sapling and acidify the soil of their needles. Inevitably forcing a growing wildlife population to come towards human settlements in order to find food, exposing rural communities at first and more recently urban areas as they depend on the vanishing buffer zone function of villages.

For the last inhabitants of the village, left aged and isolated in this forefront, the situation is also rapidly worsening. Beyond the physical exposure to wildlife and its possible tragic outcomes, constant damages as for example the crumbling of stonewalls, pathways and complex irrigation canals caused by wild boar rummages deteriorates an ancestral landscape and through it the local pride that the community has been identifying itself to for centuries.

A rising vulnerability to natural disasters in a global context of climate change is another threat to the marginal rural community. With a third of the village population in the incapacity to move by itself, due to bad physical conditions or the absence of vehicle, both criteria particularly affecting widows, the traditional local social network of mutual assistance is reaching its limits. A network that according to [passed reports](http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/0272.pdf), is of vital importance in the aftermath of natural disasters. Victims being rescued in a large majority by relatives, friends or neighbors rather than the dedicated emergency services access being difficult and the effective identification of potential victims laborious in villages where the number of uninhabited houses exceeds the number of inhabited ones.

The community house of Senjo, traditionally used as a shelter in Japanese villages is also well known for being in the most hazardous area of the mountain and the duty is left to the local leader, seventy eight years old, to drive from house to house in order to secure every villagers in the event of a disaster.

With typhoons getting more violent and frequent over the years, the nearby city of Saijo was hit by six of them in 2004, a first on existing records resulting in the death of 5 people and 5.9 billion yen in damages.  But unexpectedly the solution to avoid such tragedies in the future might be the revitalization of these marginal villages. In a country composed by 70% of mountains,  in which urban centers are located in lower plain or coastal areas the environmental condition of the mountainous upstream zones has indeed a direct impact on these downstream cities, towns and villages. And in this conditions, the village of Senjo also as the capacity to reveal by its location and unique landscape the possible positive outcomes of successful rural revitalizations. 

## Urban-rural interdependence

The extinction of small cities, towns and villages is not something that happens in a distant place that we don’t have to care - this national tendency inevitably has an effect on how we live in cities.

Paddy fields, like other water bodies, have the capacity to retain water and thus [reduce the risk of possible landslides and floods](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2735/8361565fec054472b6e06ca138b7f86f002c.pdf) resulting from heavy precipitations. Therefore, Senjo with its 2500 paddy fields spread over one thousand hectares could enhance the security of the downstream urban areas through a passive design approach that would also preserve a fading ecosystem. The cedars that cover over 20% of Japanese forests, if at last logged to build the cities that they were meant to despite of global mercantile logics, could also reduce the exposure of urban residents since the poor water absorption capacity of their roots has increases the risk of floods nationwide. 

As the standard structures against floods [have shown their limits](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201910130015.html) in Nagano Prefecture last year after the terrible damages of typhoon Hagibis, and while a new law was passed by the National Diet in the fall to promote the restoration of the last terrace paddy fields in the country, giving the opportunity to develop sustainable approaches over the systematized input of concrete, an occasion for the revitalization of Senjo's village may have come.

But despite the extraordinary vigor of Japanese elderlies living in the countryside, with **91.62% of the country population living in cities - [70% of it being concentrated on only 3% of the land](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/c0117.html) - the situation is unrealistically going to change until urban residents aware of their dependence towards the condition of rural areas** will decide to support these isolated communities. A support based on social, agricultural and environmental approaches that must be materialized by acts beyond the usual legislative body unable to prevent the upcoming tragedy of marginal villages, the furies of climate change and the issue of food security, all of which, from one way or another having an increasing impact on urban areas and being triggered by the abandonment of the rural ones.
