## What’s special about Taiwanese urbanism? 
    - quite behind 
    - urbanists are sill planning based
    - government and developers still have short term goals
    - they need to have more trans-displinary collaboration
    - important to do things locally 
    - a lot fo urbanists are not doing filed-based, participatory approach,
- what is your long term goal 
    - 1. still wanna do things locally, knowledge is not from discourse or concepts 
    - 2. Many Government sponsored projects, but wanna challenge with self-sustainable projects and some business 
- stakeholders
