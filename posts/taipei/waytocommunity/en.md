# "Dating with the community" - the Taiwanese case

One of the most powerful persons I've met during our stay in Taipei was a woman commonly called Pei Pei - a director of the governmental social project called "Way to Community". For me, she is exactly what I picture as a _community planner_ - someone who connects government, professionals, and citizens together for alternative, communal urban systems and spaces. 

After she kindly connected me with various urban practitioners in Taipei, she invited me to her office to tell what Way to Community is really about.

"In Chinese, 社區交往 (a Chinese name for Way to Community) means 'dating with the community', which is kind of an unusual and strange combination" - said Pei Pei, when we sat down at her office in the Yonghe District, Taipei. 

Way to Community started as an initiative to cherish and encourage community relationship and engagement to co-create alternative urban spaces. A few years ago she collaborated with [SHIBAURA HOUSE](http://www.shibaurahouse.jp/en), a citizen-driven cultural space in Tokyo, got inspired by a community-driven approach and international perspectives for better local practices. "citizen participation guides us a way to the community."

What she describes as part of the problems in Taipei sounds oddly familiar to me. "Usually the government pays a lot of money to invite international urban experts to have a lecture for a day, and they leave a morning after, without really knowing the context of the city and the community' needs," Pei Pei says. "That's why we started to invite some urbanists to stay in Taipei and develop some community event/workshops together in Taiwanese context, with local practitioners and citizens - it's important for us to do things local with a global frame of mind."

_Way to Community also represents a project called 'the Open Green Program' under the Taipei Regeneration Office. Not merely about landscape design, the project is about inviting more stakeholders to join place-making, through the power of urban green._

The project got funded by Taipei City Urban Regeneration Office, and during a year of the governmental project, Way to Community organized 6 international workshops to promote localized place-making with international practitioners of community empowerment from Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, The Netherlands, America, New Zealand. All of them were about exploring urban issues, sharing action methods, and learning about successful private-public cooperation. 

"We're still behind in terms of urban practices - government and developers still have short term goals with top-down planning approach. What we need is to have more trans-disciplinary collaboration and keep it persistently local, field-based, and participatory." 

I've seen so many mistakes in cities where they worship some international best practices, and copy and paste on thier own city while completely neglecting the local quality and citizens' everyday lives. Projects I learned from Pei Pei have impeccable balance between being global and local at the same time. 

Way to Community is supported by public funds, but she is ready to challenge the initiative to be self-supporting with its own resources. I can't wait to see the next development of Way to Community, and how passionate, down-to-earth, and talented practitioners like her can make more impact on our cities.
