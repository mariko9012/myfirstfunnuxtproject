# "Dating with the Community" - the Taiwanese Case

One of the most powerful people I met during my stay in Taipei was a woman commonly know as "Pei Pei" — the director of the governmental social project called "Way to Community." For me, she is exactly what I picture as a _community planner_ — someone who connects the government, professionals, and citizens together for alternative, communal urban systems and spaces. 

On top of being gracious enough to connect me with many urban practitioners in Taipei, she invited me to her office to tell me what Way to Community is really about.

"In Chinese, 社區交往 (the Chinese name for Way to Community) means 'dating with the community,' which is kind of an unusual and strange combination," said Pei Pei, when we sat down at her office in the Yonghe District in Taipei. 

Way to Community started as an initiative to cherish and encourage community relationships and engagements to co-create alternative urban spaces. A few years ago she collaborated with [SHIBAURA HOUSE](http://www.shibaurahouse.jp/en), a citizen-driven cultural space in Tokyo, and there she was inspired by their community-driven approach and international perspective in developing better local practices. In her words, "citizen participation, for us, guides the way to the community."

What she describes as part of the problem in Taipei sounds oddly familiar to me. "Usually, the government pays a lot of money to invite international urban experts to give a one-day lecture, and they leave the morning after, without really knowing the context of the city and the community's needs," Pei Pei says. "That's why we started to invite some urbanists to stay in Taipei and develop community events and workshops together in a Taiwanese context, with local practitioners and citizens — it's important for us to do things locally with a global frame of mind."

_Way to Community also represents a project called "the Open Green Program" under the Taipei Regeneration Office. Not merely about landscape design, this project is about inviting more stakeholders to join place-making through the power of 'urban green.'_

Way to Community is funded by the Taipei City Urban Regeneration Office, and during their first year as a governmental project, they organized six international workshops to promote localized place-making with international practitioners of community empowerment from Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, The Netherlands, America, and New Zealand. All were about exploring urban issues, sharing action methods, and learning about successful private-public cooperation.

"We're still behind in terms of urban practices — the government and developers still have short term goals with a top-down planning approach. What we need is to have more trans-disciplinary collaboration and to keep things consistently local, field-based, and participatory." 

I've seen so many mistakes in cities where decision makers and activists alike worship the international 'best practices,' and try to copy and paste them onto their own city while completely neglecting the local character and citizens' everyday lives. Projects I learned about from Pei Pei strike an impeccable balance between being global and local at the same time. 

Way to Community is supported by public funds, but she is preparing to challenge the initiative to be self-supporting with its own resources. I can't wait to see how Way to Community continues to develop, and how passionate, down-to-earth, and talented practitioners like her can make more impact on our cities.

_The talk event 'The French Night', where she shared her research gathered during her visit to France. I appreciated how the spirit of Way to Community is really about mutual learning, which is often neglected in favor of more tangible and visible results in the field of urbanism._
