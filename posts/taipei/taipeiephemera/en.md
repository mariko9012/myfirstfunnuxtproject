# Taipei Ephemera: In search of what makes Taipei Taipei

As an (almost) full-time traveler who loves to understand the uniqueness of each city I visit, I often create a mental image of the city, based on what I think makes the place unique as a city. I also know that everyone, either locals or outsiders, has their own certain way to identify a city to somehow make sense of it. 

What makes Taipei Taipei? was the question when Paritosh Goel, one of the most talented and passionate architects / urbanists I know, and I had in mind when we met in the capital of Taiwan. I met Paritosh two years ago in Kuala Lumper, during the 9th edition of World Urban Forum.

Our passions for cities and urban exploration made us friends so we kept in touch ever since - now, when we decided to reunite in Taipei this autumn, we wanted to do something together - that was the beginning of the idea of _Taipei Ephemera_. 

# Things collected from everywhere and anywhere

We both were new to Taipei and we wanted to acquire a deeper understanding of the city not only spatially but emotionally and culturally. This is why we came up with the idea of making a subjective, temporal map of Taipei that somehow depicts the city that exists in our heads. 

We don’t understand a city rationally as a journey from point A to point B. We understand and make sense of a city not only with our knowledge of the place, but also with our emotions, experiences, memories, and perceptions.

each person has a unique mental map based on their own perception of the city, and we thought it would be a great idea to exchange our perception through making a collective map - using ephemeral objects. 

"Ephemera" are collectible memorabilia that is, or was, for a short term purpose. It could be plane tickets, printed paper bags for street food, postcards and more... it could be anything, things from all backgrounds, cultures, places — things found, or bought, or received. Ephemera might not be normally considered something to collect, save, or cherish, but oftentimes, we do keep them, either physically or mentally in your memories. 

# Dialogue through Collective Mapping 

The map we made was 2.5 meters by 2.4 meters. we used eight A0 papers and taped together. Around 20 participants including artists, designers and some random locals who were walking by and decided to join us when we called them in. 

We asked them two questions - what makes Taipei Taipei? Where (or what element) fo you feel at home in Taipei? They took worksheets and answer these questions.

Then, they used a mix of ephemera we provided - we asked the participants to bring their own ephemera if needed in advance, and some of them brought some personal objects that represent their idea of Taipei. Some of them went out during the 6 hours-long workshops to pick up more random things from the streets. They cut it, pile it, or connect it with other materials, and with markers and stickers or watercolors we provided, we collectively created a collage of Taipei - Taipei in their hearts, Taipei in their memories or images, Taipei they treasure. 


During the workshop, we also spent time to talk to individual participants to collect thier stories about Taipei. Some of them talked about cycling culture in the city, some of them express the idea of how Taipei101 does NOT define the uniqueness of the city... These stories made us understand more of the city, betray (in a good way) our expectations to update and strengthen our "ephemeral" mental image of Taipei.

Ephemerality is the concept of things being transitory, existing only briefly - but I don't know, as we sometimes keep some ephemera to cherish and embed in our memory, certain things are eternal and boundless. 


We are planning to document the map in the form of a book - "_Taipei Ephemera_" so that anyone can read people's thoughts about what makes Taipei Taipei. We'll continue doing the collective map-making workshop in the other part of the world, such as Japan, India, Indonesia or Germany - through this process, we might be able to promote urbanism beyond the boundaries of Nation-states and attain mutual learning. Please contact us if you are interested in being part of the project.
