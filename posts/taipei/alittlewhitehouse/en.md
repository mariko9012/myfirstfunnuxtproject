# Gather, repair, make - Taipei's maintanace station 

I found a kind of space in Taipei that I've always, always wanted. 

a group of passionate people share tools here to learn and help each other.

Just a few steps away from the bustling Longquan Traditional Market in the MRT Taipower Building Station.

space is filled with a variety of tools: wrenches, hammers, wire saws, electric drills, and frosted disks are just a treasure trove of maintenance. Residents nearby knew that if something was broken in the house, they were brought here on the weekend morning. Under the leadership of volunteers, old things could be reborn in a few steps.
