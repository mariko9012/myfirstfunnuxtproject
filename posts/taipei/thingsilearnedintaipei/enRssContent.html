<p>One can learn a lot from visiting a new city. In this Novermber, we've spent a month in Taipei, in order to observe its urban scene and also organise my own workshop there, hoping to meet some fellow city lovers. During the process, I've met some amazing urbanists who showed me not only the beautity of Taipei and its challenges. This post is my memorandum for the things I've learned in the mesmerizing capital of Taiwan.</p>
<h2>Urban Co-living</h2>
<p>I've seen some experimental way of living and cohabitation here in Taipei.</p>
<p>During our stay there, we decided to stay in <a href="https://www.9floorspace.com/">玖樓 9floor</a>, an initiative that works towards co-living for tomorrow. A group of young</p>

<p>Taipei West Town is an online Magazine for Taiwanese aiming at delivering the local spirits and irregularly reporting in-depth trip routes and selections that embedded the cultural characteristics. The content comprises authentic local tastes, places, cultural memory, and regional consciousness that hidden in Taipei.</p>
<p>This is a team with online photographers and writers who are low-keyed, fastidious and persistent. We do not want to take everything happened in daily life for granted. Therefore, we seize the moments that glitter in the intervals of time before they are gone as a way to show our gratitude for the land. Literature and photography are the approaches we use to interpret what we see in daily life. Thus, experiences are individual-oriented and rather subjective. Taipei West Town expects itself as short take. We record and interpret the struggles and perseverance of the old town with a great patience to see the chemical reaction in this experiment. Through the outsider’s perspective, the lonely individuals in city can have the chance to review their uniqueness and lead a good life.</p>
<p>“Why West Town?” asked by many people.</p>
<p>The development of Taipei started from the West Town. Up till now, this area still embraces people with various beliefs in all works of life. There are aerial roots of the trees swing and the sunshine dances through the leaves in front of the temple. At night, one might accidentally come across the historical site in the red brick alley. We use West Town as our name, Taipei as starting point, and the story we share is the story about Taiwanese. Taipei West Town will keep recording ordinary stories that happen in this humid city. We sincerely invite the lost-in-city readers to walk into the daily life of Taipei like an insider, be amazed by the city’s prosperity, and might also express in wonder unconsciously, “Umm, now I realized that there is also some ways to live in Taipei.”</p>
