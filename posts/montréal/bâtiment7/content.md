# Batiment 7, another great place to gather in Montréal

[Bâtiment 7](http://www.batiment7.org/en/home/) is a historic industrial building that has been convered into a hub for alternative project spaces and people to gather. It's located in a neighbourhood called Pointe-Saint-Charles and is a bit difficult to reach from downtown, but it's worth visiting for thier occatinoal events & workshops, or even to have drinks at thier bar and shop organic food.

Pointe-Saint-Charles is historically a working-class area. By the 1860s the neighbourhood became busy with industrial works - numerous working class families moved in, including Irish immigrants and French-Canadians. 

The neighbourhood went into a long decline in the 1960s. However, it has recently regained its popularity and they have been various new construction of housing units and comdominiums, inclusing renovation projects of industrial buildings like Bâtiment 7.

Satisfying basic needs is the bedrock of the Building 7 project.

In this virtually service-free area of Pointe St. Charles, Building 7 banks on providing basic consumer producs, the means of production and spaces for social interaction. As the only place in the area in which to simultaneously find carrots, lunch, community references, beer and some plain, healthy hustle and bustle, Building 7 finds its legitimacy in the heart of scarcity. It will provide the surrounding population with an authentic and bustling environment, an intergenerational crossroads, at all hours of the day.

As the project openly seeks to transcend socio-economic disparities, it constitutes a solid foundation for the dignity of an entire community, the only possible path towards a complete neighbourhood.
