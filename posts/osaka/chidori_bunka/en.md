# Chidori-Bunka, A New Community Space By Dot Architects

I wrote an article on [World Architecture Community](http://worldarchitecture.org/) about Chidori-Bunka - a community centre, art space, a shop and bar, located at the edge of the second biggest city in Japan, Osaka. Renovated by [dot architects](https://worldarchitecture.org/community/links/?waurl=http://dotarchitects.jp), this places is full of love and respect toward ordinary buildings and amateur carpentry.
