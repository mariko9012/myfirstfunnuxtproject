<p>I wrote an article on <a href="http://worldarchitecture.org/">World Architecture Community</a> about Chidori-Bunka — a community centre, art space, a shop and bar, located at the edge of the second biggest city in Japan, Osaka. Renovated by <a href="https://worldarchitecture.org/community/links/?waurl=http://dotarchitects.jp">dot architects</a>, this places is full of love and respect toward ordinary buildings and amateur carpentry.</p>
