### Things to do, places to go

- It's been said that Chicago's Neighborhood Parks is one of [the 10 parks that changed America](https://interactive.wttw.com/ten/parks/chicagos-neighborhood-parks). In the late 19C, the two designers [Frederick Law Olmsted](http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com/) and Calvert Vaux executed that vision in a system of smaller neighborhood parks that serve better for immigrants and working-class people in Chicago.

- Downtown Chicago is beautiful - but once you take the stairs to go down to the ground, you see the completely different landscape of [underground space](https://www.chicagodetours.com/exploring-underground-chicago-layers/) of the city. There are hidden restaurants and bars & clubs, and it's quite fun for urban adventurers.

- It's quite interesting to learn how Chicago sold one of its skyways to the private sector. [Chicago sold the Chicago Skyway for \$1.8 billion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5TFhucZ-R4)
