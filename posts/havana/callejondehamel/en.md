[Callejon de Hamel](https://havanatimes.org/?p=106918) is a moderate size street that is hidden in Cayo Hueso neighborhood, and is one of the main centers of Afro-Cuban culture in Havana. The street is full of open-air galleries and public art pieces, which let you immerse yourself in the Afro-Cuban creativity.

Callejon de Hamel cannot be understood without [Salvador Gonz√°lez Escalona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Gonz%C3%A1les_Escalona), the Cuban sculptor and muralist who started transforming this small alley in around 1989. It was very simple how it started - one of the neighbors in the alley asked him to paint the facade of his house. The project then started involving locals and visitors, which eventually turned this street from a slum into a current form - one of the most vibrant destinations to enjoy Afro-Cuban culture. Now, there are many workshops and educational programs for local kids to participate.

The surrounding Cayo Hueso neighborhood once had a notorious reputation due to its poverty. The neighborhood was named after Fernando Belleau Hamel, a US citizen of Franco-German origin, who bought lands there at the early 20th century - he started a business of foundry and hire a large black and Chinese population. Today, it has become a place where the Afro Cuban art is practiced and presented. I highly recommend a visit!
