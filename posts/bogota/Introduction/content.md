When it comes to Bogota, I only watched [Cities on Speed: Bogota Change (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757707/) and knew a little bit about the famous mayor Enrique Peñalosa - my kwnoledge of the city was quite limited. Luckily I had a local architect friend who was kind enough to walk through the city with me. Here are the list of things I learned from a talented Columbian architect Ricardo Torres Gomez, as well as things I found by myself.

### Things to do, places to go

- [Parque Bicentenario](https://www.greenroofs.com/projects/parque-bicentenario-bogota/) is one of the first places Ricardo showed me, and it is definitely interesting. Designed by a Columbian architect Gian Carlo Mazzanti and inaugurated in 2016, this urban park has designed to pass over Avenida El Dorado, one of the major vehicular arteries in Bogota. The city was (and still is) divided between the north part and the south, creating serious polarization and social inqueality. This park was designed in a hope to create natural connectivities and revitalize downtown.

- I personally think [Biblioteca Virgilio](https://www.biblored.gov.co/bibliotecas/biblioteca-virgilio) is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful libraries in the world. It was designed by one of the most famous Colombian architects [Rogelio Salmona](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogelio_Salmona). The building has a fascinating circular structure, carefully designed to create a seamless landscape with the surrounding park and fountains.

- Every Sunday in Bogota, you can enjoy car free _[Ciclovía](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/9/13017282/bogota-ciclovia-open-streets)_. 112km of roads that streaches from the south to the north are closed up for cars, allowing cyclists and runners to take over the streets. The program was created and promoted in the 1990s and early 2000s, under Bogotá Mayor Enrique Peñalosa and his brother Gil Peñalosa. Gil Peñalosa now has a non-profit organization called [880cities](https://www.880cities.org/) that is entirely dedicated to the topic of urban mobility.

  It is ABSOLUTELY NOT true that Justin Bieber's visit to Bogota opened doors for Colombian graffiti artists.

- plaza de espana

- the apartment building and bull fighting

- the tallest building in Bogota [BD Bacatá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BD_Bacat%C3%A1) is suspended.

### Read

- [Mike's Bogota Blog](http://mikesbogotablog.blogspot.com/) might be a great introduction to the city from an urbanist's perspective. [Bogota Times](https://thebogotapost.com/) is a good English resrouces to get a gist of the citym too.

- Before visiting Bogota by myself, I always thought [Enrique Peñalosa](https://twitter.com/EnriquePenalosa?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) was the coolest hero who saved Bogota from being "the most dangerous city in the world". However, after talking to some local urbanists, I found out that it's not as black and white as that. It might be [time to Rethink the Legacy of Enrique Peñalosa?](https://www.planetizen.com/blogs/95348-it-time-rethink-legacy-enrique-pe-alosa), including his creation [TransMilenio](https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/).

- Did you know that Le Corbusier came to Bogotá in 1947, and had [a master plan](http://www.lecorbusierenbogota.com/template.php?pg=includes%2Floslibros&fbclid=IwAR0sxP_s8O2kCztJM2NraQkhYa3K8dubqom7Dl4t6tjM8Fxy8WBKiQ3UJHo) for Columbia's capital city? It might be questionable if we could call Bogota as "[Le Corbusier City](https://thecitypaperbogota.com/bogota/the-corbusier-city/3672)", but it is surely interesting to look at the contrast between the urban development proposal of Le Corbusier to the current layout and reality of the city.

- Movie! and the shopping mall.
