- [The Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)](http://www.welcometocup.org/) is a nonprofit organization that uses the power of design and art to increase meaningful civic engagement. It's quite inspiring to see how they collaborate with artists, designers, students, and citizens to increase awareness around urban issues and build communities.

- [BMW Guggenheim Lab](http://www.bmwguggenheimlab.org/) is an 'traveling' urban think tank/laboratory and community center. Unfortunately it's not active anymore, but this idea of having an mobile laboratory focusing on urban life inspires me so much!

- [youarethecity](http://www.youarethecity.com/) is an urban research, design and planning practice. I like thier bottom-up approach arguing that everybody has agency in designing cities and urban space.

- [Van Alen Institute](https://www.vanalen.org/) is an organization that believes design can transform cities, landscapes, and regions to improve peopleâ€™s lives. Their projects and website are full of inspiration.
