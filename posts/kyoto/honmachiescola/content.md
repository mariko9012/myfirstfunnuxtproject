# Honmachi Escola: In praise of Do It Yourselfism

One thing that we've encountered and continuously been impressed by in Kyoto is the culture of "make it your own". We've seen a number of sustainable self-build projects, that is lodging an eloquent protest against the homogenization of our cities and uncontainable consumerism now rolling across the globe.

Above all, we believe [Honmachi Escola](http://www.escola-kyoto.com/escola-index.html) helps us reconceive our relationship with communities in cities and our way of living.

Honmachi Escola is a project to utilize a complex of 8 unused buildings and 350ãŽ¡ open square in Honmachi neighborhood close to [Sanjusangendo](https://kyoto.travel/en/shrine_temple/159). Currently, three buildings of the complex are used for accommodations, the rests are studios and offices. It's hard to explain what [Honmachi Escola](http://www.escola-kyoto.com/escola-index.html) is about in one word, though. Probably that is the point - it might not really be about the definition, but rather what this place, at the deepest level, might mean for those who live there and visit there.

## "Escola" - a place to learn

This area is known by its aging population and high ratio of vacant houses, and old buildings in the narrow alleyways that are typical to an old neighborhood like this are usually quite hard to process reconstruction. The complex now known as Honmachi Escola used to be one of those abandoned properties.

The project was born in 2014 with support of [HAPS](http://haps-kyoto.com/en/), non-profit organization to support Kyoto-based artists, and public funding from the city of Kyoto. Sasaki, an artist of Brazilian music, first had an idea of creating a gathering place to invite music lovers like himself. With the help of Jun Yamaguchi, an architectural researcher of the Ritsumei University at a time, as well as other community members, the project has evolved since then. They named the place "Escola" - a Portuguese word for "school". Honmachi Escola is surely a place people can learn from each other.

## DIY Spirit and art of self-building

Sasaki, Yamaguchi, and the other community members designed a whole renovation plan and slowly started updating & customizing the place based on their needs. Now there are appositely 10 people in the community who are actively living and using their studios there, being part of the ever-updating self-building process in the Escola.

> "Human creativity can't play its role in the fixed, given condition. That's why it's important that we do it by ourselves"

says Jun Yamaguchi, who participated in the interview with us.

They are aiming for creating a strong community and sustainable buildings and infrastructures in the heart of the city. The tenants have their own unique skills and expertise too, that varies from architecture to ecology. "When we bring everyone's skills together, we can make almost anything that we use in our everyday lives." passionately says Leo, one of the residents in Escola.

_The first thing that greeted me at the entrance was this sign - which was used at a workshop they organized a few weeks ago. I'd love to live in a community where such an interesting workshop like this would be held._

\_Leo, who studies ecology, explains how they grow vegetables and herbs in their garden.
They get ready-to-use natural manure (elephant, giraffe, and zebra) from Kyoto City Zoo, where Leo studied for a year, and use ithem as a fertilizer as well as for improving thier homemade compost.

## What's next?

They are open to the public a few times a year, hosting events, fairs, and workshops to invite people to this community. They have various programs to invite students and artist to hold fieldworks and short-term artist in residence etc.

Residents' passion for do-it-youselfism never stops. too. They are continuously developing ideas such as installing sustainable energy system, updated water system, raising chickens and bees, and more.

They are also conscious to develop a more meaningful relationship with the neighborhood.

"This neighborhood is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Kyoto. We are witnessing a new wave of redevelopment around here, but we try to sustain & deepen our relationship with the neighborhoods. I am from Paris, and I know what happens to cities through gentrification. I don't want it to happen here, and we try our best to play our role to fight against the homogenization of our cities and consumerism." says Leo.

Recently, interest has surged in the idea of small-scale, incremental, do-it-yourself urban improvement. A self-building project that is resident-generated, low budget, and substantially bottom-up like Honmachi Escola, has the potential to encourage people for the alternative urban way of living.
