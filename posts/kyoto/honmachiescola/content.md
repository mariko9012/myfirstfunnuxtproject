# Honmachi Escola: In praise of Do It Yourselfism

One thing that we've encountered and continuiysly been impressed by in Kyoto is the culture of "make it your own". We've seen a number of sustainable self-build projects, that is lodging an eloquent protest against the homogenization of our cities and uncontainable consumerism now rolling across the globe.

Above all, we believe [Honmachi Escola](http://www.escola-kyoto.com/escola-index.html) helps us reconceive our relationship with communities in cities and our way of living.

Honmachi Escola is a project to utilize a complex of 8 unused buildings and 350ãŽ¡ open aquare in Honmachi neighrbhoood close to [Sanjusangendo](https://kyoto.travel/en/shrine_temple/159). Currently three buildings of the complex are used for accomodations, the rest are studios and offices. It's hard to explain what [Honmachi Escola](http://www.escola-kyoto.com/escola-index.html) is about in one word, thought. Probably that is the point - it might not really be about definition, but rather what this place, at the deepest level, might mean for those who live there and visit there.

## "Escola" - a place to learn

This area is known by its aging population and high ratio of vacant houses, and old buildings in the narrow alleyways that are typical to old neighrbouoood like this are usually quite hard to process reconstruction. The complex now knowen as Honmachi Escola used to be one of those abandoned property, and common ownership of the place made revitalization even more challenging.

The project was born in 2014 with a support of [HAPS](http://haps-kyoto.com/en/), non-profit organization to support Kyoto-based artists, and public funding from the city of Kyoto. Sasaki, an artist of Brazilian music, first had an idea of creating a gathering place to invite music lovers like himself. With a help of Jun Yamaguchi, an architectural researcher of the Ritsumei University, as well as other community members, the project has evoled since then. They named the place "escola" - a portugieese word for "school". Honmachi Escola is surelly a place people can learn from each other.

## DIY Spirit and an art of self building

Sasaki, Yamaguchi, and the other community members designed a whole renovation plan and slowlly started updating & costomizig the place based on thier needs. Now there are appomimetly 10 people in the community who are activily living and using thier studios there, being part of the ever-updating self-building process in the Escola.

says Jun Yagaguchi, who particitated the interview with us.

They are aiming for creating an storng community and sustainable buildings and infrustructures in the heart of the city. The tenants have thier own unique skills and expertises too, that varies from architecture to ecology. "When we bring everyone's skills together, we can make almost anything that we use in our everyday lives." passionately says Leo, one of the residents in Escola.

_The first thing that greeted me at the entrance was this sign - which was used at a workshop they organized few weeks ago. I'd love to live in a community where such an interesting workshop like this would be held._

## Whta's next?

They are open to the public fews times a year, hosting events, fairs and workshops to invite people for this community. They have various programs to invite students and artist to hold fieldworks nd short-term artist in residece etc.

Residencts' passion for do-it-youselfism never stops. too. They are continuously developing ideas such as installing sustainable energy systemm, updated water system, raising chickens and bees, and more.

They are also counscious to develop more meaningful relationship with the neighrbohood.

"This neighbrohood is one of the oldest neighrbohoods in Kyoto. We are witnessing a new wave of redevelopment around here, but we try to sustain & deepen our relationship with the neighrbohods. I am from Paris, and I know what happens to cities through gentrification. I don't want it to happen here, and we try our best to play our role to fight against the homogenization of our cities and consumerism." says Leo.

Recently, interest has surged in the idea of small-scale, incremental, do-it-yourself urban improvement. Self-building project that is resident-generated, low budget, and substantially bottom-up like Honmachi Escola, has a potential to encourage people for alternative urban way of living.
