There is absolutely no better way to relax than soaking in a hot good _sento_ - Japanese traditional public bath. While hundreds of sento have closed thier business in the past decades, there is still a good chance to stumble across a local _sento_ in Kyoto's neighrbouhoods. They are small, local, and architecturally beatifull. It simply breaks my heart that _sento_ is a dissapring spieces.

However, Some of the _sento_ maintain to be a social hub even after they closure of thier business. In the past, a _sento_ was simply a place to bathe - These days, however, there are some interesting renovation projects that preserves its architectural, cultural value and breathe new life into it.

# Kujoyu - From nostalgia to

[Kujoyu](https://kujoyu.com/rentalspace/) was a _sento_ that opened earyly 昭和時代 and closed down 10 years ago. The owner of the buildings saw a value in a traditional woodenbudiling and decided to renovate it as an open event space.

Some parts are still in the same shape as it was back then - Bathtabs, a weighing machine, sinks and fans. There is just no water in the bathtabs, but you can sill enjoy its nostalgic feeling.

# Public bath culture in Japan

It is located in a residential neighrborhood and is rather hard to find, but it is definitely worth visiting to experiece how new spirits and culture can live in a old structure.
