<p>I wrote an article on <a href="http://worldarchitecture.org/">World Architecture Community</a> about <a href="https://www.concon.kyoto/">SHIKIAMI CONCON</a>, a building complex consisting of a combination of three traditional Japanese terrace houses and 19 shipping containers. I used to think that there's nothing unexplored in the genre of container architecture, but a combination of a Machiya (traditional Japanese wooden houses) and containers was totally a surprise.</p>
