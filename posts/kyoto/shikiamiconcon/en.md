# SHIKIAMI CONCON, A Mix Of Container Architecture And Japanese Traditional Townhouse

I wrote an article on [World Architecture Community](http://worldarchitecture.org/) about [SHIKIAMI CONCON](https://www.concon.kyoto/), a building complex consisting of a combination of three traditional Japanese terrace houses and 19 shipping containers. I used to think that there's nothing unexplored in the genre of container architecture, but a combination of a Machiya (traditional Japanese wooden houses) and containers was totally a surprise.
