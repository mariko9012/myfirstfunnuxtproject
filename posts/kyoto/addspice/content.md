# Interview with Chika Kishimoto

![](addspice1.jpg)
We've recently moved to Kyoto, more specificaly to a creative sharehouse called [REDIY](http://mayshare.chu.jp/REDIY/), where we've been building furniture and renovating the rooms with our artistic neighrbours. Before we've decided to choose this sharehouse, we've done an intense research about diy-able apartment in Kyoto, as we are sick and tired of strict Japanese propertiy lows and renting regulation.

You might have no idea how hard it is to paint walls, repholster floors and build your own wall shelves at home in Japanese apartments - even to put your favorite posters on a wall. If you are renting a regular apartment through a regular realtor, chances are high that there should not be even a single nail hole on your wall when you move out - that means there is a very little room to play with your crative mind and customize your dream nest in Japan unless you actually own a place.

However, there has been gradually more and more interesting spots that allow residents and renters to explore new possibilities in where they live.

We found this listing site called [DIYP](http://diyp.jp/kyoto/) during our reserach which allows you to check out some DIY-able homes (both for buying and renting). In Kyoto, we got a chance to talk to a director of DIYP Kyoto, who is updating a real estate scene of this old capital of Japan.

## Chika Kishimoto - a real estate planner

\*One of the real estate properties she is currently working on.\*

"House owners and land owners themselves don't often know what to do with thier properties. My job is to find potential and make a proposal of what these places could be and help them implement the plan." says Chika Kishimoto, a real estate "planner" and the founder of addSPICE(http://addspice.jp/).

"There has been a recent movement of renovation and adaptive reuses all over Japan especially in Tokyo, allowing some unused properties in the city to be recreated to something anew. In Kyoto, however, there aren't many players to make this happen - it's also hard to find avaible listenings online in Kyoto too, there are hidden - so I found a need to develop the market here. "

Kishimoto took a degree in architecture and decided to pursuit her career as a realter instead. Most of realters leave after they find renters, and architects tend to do the same after a construction is finished and buildings are done. But her job doesn't stop there. "I am interested in what kind of life and everyday lives that are happening in those places." she says.

## Why Kyoto and what's speial about it?

In a historical city like Kyoto, neighrbouhood ties and local communities are more notisable than in big cities like Tokyo. It takes time to gain trust from owners and build relationship with local communities, thus all the proceeses take more time. "I've realized that it's important to think about Kyoto-ness to develop a meaning proposal that works well in a community."

"In kyoto, house owners and land owners tend to have long term perspective on thier projects. That's another thing that makes this city special compared to Tokyo - consideration for time and next generation."
Thus, she is not keen on just following trend, and trying to find long term value for a community.

Kishimoto also organises a program and [a website](https://kyoto-iju.com/) called "Kyoto Iju Keikaku (means Moving to Kyoto program)". The program encourages people to move in to this former capital of Japan, helping them find new jobs and immerse themselves in a new lifestyle in Kyoto. She has just published a [book](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E4%B8%8D%E5%8B%95%E7%94%A3%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC%E6%B5%81%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89%E3%83%AA%E3%83%8E%E3%83%99%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3-%E5%B2%B8%E6%9C%AC-%E5%8D%83%E4%BD%B3/dp/4761527056/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1555860788&refinements=p_27%3A%E5%B2%B8%E6%9C%AC%E5%8D%83%E4%BD%B3&s=books&sr=1-1) too, about her career as a real estate planner. I can't wait to see what's more to come in Kyoto!
