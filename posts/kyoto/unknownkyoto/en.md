# UNKNOWN KYOTO, A New Multi-Purpose Building In Kyoto, Japan

I wrote an article on [World Architecture Community](http://worldarchitecture.org/) about UNKNOWN KYOTO, a newly renovated multi-purpose building including a guesthouse, restaurant, coworking-space standing on a former red-light district of Kyoto. The existing Yūkaku-architecture was beautifully renovated by [expo](http://expomade.com/) - I recommend all the architecture lovers to give a visit!
