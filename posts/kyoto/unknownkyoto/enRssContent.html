<p>I wrote an article on <a href="http://worldarchitecture.org/">World Architecture Community</a> about UNKNOWN KYOTO, a newly renovated multi-purpose building including a guesthouse, restaurant, coworking-space standing on a former red-light district of Kyoto. The existing Yūkaku-architecture was beautifully renovated by <a href="http://expomade.com/">expo</a> — I recommend all the architecture lovers to give a visit!</p>
