  "I still don't know how to describe this space", says // with a smile. "That is fine and I believe it is actually good, leaving "

Come to think of it, I still haven't seen many critical studies or experiments on the topic of hotels, hostels and other touristic facilities in our city, and thier imapct on local cultrue and community.
