### Things to do, places/project to check out

- Participate [URBANING_U](http://urbaning.org/u/) which is a two day camp, that let you learn more about Tokyo thorough urbanist's perspective.

- If you're an cyclist and want to experience biking in Tokyo, I absolutely recommend [TOKYO BY BIKE](https://flipboard.com/@byronkidd/tokyo-by-bike-2gjbbsugy) - this is a very helpful introduction to Japan's bike scene.

- I love the art center [ongoing](http://www.ongoing.jp/ja/artcenter/index.php), which is a special art space / gallery that is very accessible to any artists, including un-famous, fledgling ones.

### Read

- Follow [BeingTokyo](http://beingtokyo.com/), which is a rotation curation account on Twitter.

- Check out the books by [Flick Studio](http://www.flickstudio.jp/index.html), which is a publishing company specialized in Architecture and urban design.

- I like watching NHK's project [Tokyo Miracle City](http://www.nhk.or.jp/special/tmc/) - fragments of everyday lives by Tokyoists.

### Organization

- [mi-rimeter](http://mi-ri.com/) is a great team that practice bottom-up urban intervention and tactical urbanism. They also have a [design farm](http://urbaning.jp/)

- [Shibuya Hack Project](http://shibuyahack.com/) believes in the citizen's power and right to cities.

- [Urbanist Meetup](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1546778725440736/) is an online community of people who love city, architecture, urban design, real estate and community development.

- If you love gardening, you'd love [Tokyo Green Space](https://tokyogreenspace.com/tag/tokyo-diy-gardening/) and  this facebook community [Urban Farming Tokyo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/urbanfarmingtokyo/)
