<p>I visited <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://waterfrontseattle.org/">Friends of Waterfront</a> in Seattle last month to learn about <ahref="https://www.travelingcircusofurbanism.com/seattle/waterfrontdevelopment">the future of Seattle's waterfront</a>. They are already in a phase of implementing their concrete action plan, explaining it to citizens and having them involved.</p>
<p>It seems like Seattle is not the only one in the game of reimagining its urban waterfront though. While it is still a phase of calling for a comprehensive plan, Vancouver also has been talking about the future of their waterfront.</p>
<p>The other day, there was <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://www.sfu.ca/publicsquare/upcoming-events/city-conversations.html">SFU City Conversations</a> by <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.sfu.ca/publicsquare.html">SFU Public Square</a> to have a conversation about the Waterfront with citizens.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://georgiastrait.org/">The Georgia Strait Alliance</a> recently published <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.waterfrontinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Waterfront-Full-Report-Web.pdf">a report</a> that summarizes the current state/potential of the Waterfront.<br>
The report is a great piece of work, and, in my opinion, worth reading.</p>

<p>The Waterfront Initiative has been an exercise since 2013 - they have been spending 5 years in facilitating broad stakeholder conversation and networking. Their goal is to manage the interface between land and sea and have a great waterfront like in the New York City and other cities. The report focuses on five key themes â€” working, living, access to nature, ecosystems, and transportation.</p>

*Waterfront Cities of the World: Vancouver*
<p>At the open-air conversation that took place in a public park just steps away from the Burrard inlet, the expats spoke only about 20 mins - the rest of the time was dedicated to participants; citizens. The conversation went from swim-ability of the water, the leadership of the redevelopment initiative, and ironically, lack of conversation between expats and citizens to create a big vision together.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Waterfront development in other cities, I would recommend keeping an eye on the process of how the discussion would develop in Vancouver from now on. All the waterfront is different, obviously, but we can learn from a process itself about how we build a comprehensive plan from scratch with help of citizens.</p>
