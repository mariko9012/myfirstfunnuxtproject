### Things to do, places/project to check out

1. [The Urbanist SF](http://www.theurbanistsf.com/)has super exiting
[San Francisco Kit](https://squareup.com/market/urbanist-sf/pedestrian-essentials-tote), which is everything we need to explore the city. I love the idea of having a starter kit for newcomers to the city, which is packed with all the passion/knowledge/love of the urbanist!

### Read

2. [TraceSF](http://tracesf.com/) is an online journal that critically explores San Francisco Bay Area design, culture, and urbanism.

3. Curbed SF has great [mapping project](https://sf.curbed.com/maps) that you can spend hours browsing!
