13. [BMW Guggenheim Lab](http://www.bmwguggenheimlab.org/) is an 'traveling' urban think tank/laboratory and community center. Unfortunately it's not active anymore, but this idea of having an mobile laboratory focusing on urban life inspires me so much!

- [youarethecity](http://www.youarethecity.com/) is an urban research, design and planning practice. I like thier bottom-up approach arguing that everybody has agency in designing cities and urban space.

- [Van Alen Institute](https://www.vanalen.org/) is an organization that believes design can transform cities, landscapes, and regions to improve peopleâ€™s lives. Their projects and website are full of inspiration.

- [The center for urban pedagogy](http://welcometocup.org/) is a nonprofit organization that uses the power of design and art to increase meaningful civic engagement.
