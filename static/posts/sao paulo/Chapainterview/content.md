### Chapa Project

---

***Thank you very much for your time. First of all, please tell me a bit more about your background and your relationship with South America?***

**Stiphany:** I travelled in Latin America prior to graduating from school, and was in Brazil for quite some time. During the stay, I ended up meeting my mentor who is a sociologist and  then dean of an architecture school in Sao Paolo. She told me what architecture and urbanism in Latin America is all about.

She was an inter-disciplinarian  within an architectural school, which was important because she was interested in very serious research, really understanding, rather than speaking for communities, actually understanding what they want and how they actually live.

I learned a lot from her for a year and I went to graduate school in architecture.  Within that trajectory I really kind of got away from this ***idea of informality***, I mean I really started to focus on the object.

>It was XXXXX the residents had been constructing this XXXX over the course of, I think the developer had abandoned it after it had reached 3 stories, and now it was about 9 or 10 stories. So, I documented that project.

### The idea of informality

***Could you explain more about the idea of informality and what it means to your project?***

**Stiphany:** Architecture school is about creating the new, rather than this XXXX set that is the city, this layering dimension. I was really interested in this layering of these social issues, these technical issues and how that is informed by these broader processes, these Unchecked growths and informality.

I got a job at Studio Gang in Chicago and then went on to do a full WRITE in Sao Paulo and I lived within BUMBOHAO which is a small, very small community of maybe 500-550 families in the North-Eastern sector of Sao Paulo.

It was about interviewing people understanding where they got their materials how that informed house construction, how that informed social networks. So, I studied this community and the built in environment for a year and then watched in be torn down by a new development project. The fluidity, the extent to which those processes were created over time, that I learned about were wiped out by the government in a very short period of time resonated deeply with me.

I then went on to do a PhD focusing on re-development, this interface between broad structural issues and the agency of individuals and the agency of communities, how those come together in very messy ways. For me, that’s really where the potential for urban design lies. Depending on what makes  XXXXX  how can people make it to XXXXX so I studied educational spaces, how people who have been involved in house building processes. How that is actually a pedagogical process, learning the city, learning how to create new forms of citizenship within the contexts that have deep inequalities but also deep potentials. So I studied ethno-graphically two larger communities over the next 5 years, and was fortunate enough to have that project funded by the national science foundation. They also funded a post-doc to study the same communities quantitatively. That’s when my research took a turn. It started to become less about my observations but really including creating platforms through which others could take agency.

***Right.***

### Participatory technology and data
>**Stiphany:** I am interested in Technology to the extent to which it de-familiarises us with city and things that we think we are familiar. I started that exploration as a photographer as an undergraduate in Fine Arts.
>I didn't speak Portuguese at the time and so technology was a way to communicate. Also, my  camera was always with me.


**Stiphany:** That is where the technology piece comes in. So the NSF post-doc and the XXXXX is really about helping citizens, communities and governments to design their futures using technology. The project had 2 main goals, one is to create this new database, to understand what is there rather than wiping out the settlements before you make design decisions. Instead of returning things to a modernist XXXX, also expanding the scope of architecture to include questions of infrastructure and how it can start to be something that is more socially and technically situated within the realities of the formality.

The project is a collaboration between two community organisations and along the way, given that it is a random sample, we met all kinds of people much like what you (mariko) are doing.

Within these two communities that I thought I knew very intimately, ethnographically I took a totally  different journey through random selection. The stories begin to become even more layered. You have these different community organisations and we got into touch with the youth and got an understanding of their perspective of formality and their future role and interests. That really helped with the very practical things of designing technology that teenagers are going to go to before Facebook. I learned about FOMO and those sorts of terms through Brazilian youth in the Favelas. That informed the design of the tool. This really tried to have a set of policy makers are interested in until it is visualised into something that community members can see on a block by block basis, it really changed things.

Another thing that was important about the data is that in Sao Paulo, like many cities around the world, but especially in the global south they are being lotted, and rightly so, for mapping informality and formality we understand not only where informality is happening.

The data tends to stop at the borders so Chapa's primary goal was to get a much finer grain of data at the block level, at the lot level and at the level of the individual. It is really about the human experience. There is the translation to design, which is what we have been focused on over the past year. So we are starting, myself and Nathan Brigman, Chapa Studio which would be more of a private development thing. So we would maintain Chapa Urban Labs as a research platform and then we will do Chapa Studio as a for-profit endeavour through which we can fund concrete projects in these communities because the research is not working yet.

I think Chapa is an opportunity to create new connections between architecture and urbanism. It encompasses the bio-physical challenges that are inherent to any informal situation. I think 60% of slums or favelas in Sao Paulo or in Brazil are situated around a water XXXXXX so that is one issue. The other issue that we are getting into is health and the extent to which informal settlements have differing health problems. The platform started as something about the built in environment and how certain social or family situations evolve. It has now become something about the broader issues of health, bio-physical processes, environmentalism in the city related to the condition of informality and post-industrialisation.

We are looking for broader scales of impact and are now working on a corridor that begins to encompass one of the case studies and a string of small informal communities along the same area. We are using scenario planning to analyse different ways to structure the future of informality, that’s what we are interested in, so that it is not a full clean out and its not just doing nothing. One of the reasons this is important in Sao Paulo and Brazil is that recently there has been a shift away from upgrading. Since the 1980's the governments in Latin America have upgraded and improved upon informal settlements, they are now saying it is too fussy, they are returning the mass peripheral housing. Like Mia Casa, Mia Vida, Mexico has Invo na vi and Chile also does it. Kuma no davos is a social emancipation tool so that citizens have their own data, its a way to link architecture and XXXXX, its a way to inform urban design decisions but its also a way to resist this broader neglect of informal settlements that have consolidated in the poor over the past 3 to 4 decades.

Mariko: 3 to 4 decades XXXX

**Stiphany:**  So the two cases that we are engaged in Heliopolis and Sao Fransico they were settled in the late 1960's

***Are you think in the future to apply this methodology and this project into some other part of the world? This project is XXXXX this big but you can also take essence out of that and apply a similar study in South-East Asia.***

**Stiphany:** We do. We have a contact there and we have two projects, on the 'possible' burner here on the border and we are also in contact with Argentina. We have some massive things going on.  That's the idea. How do you scale something up but also maintain it as a situated infrastructure?

***Exactly. I have a feeling that this project is based on not only collaborations but also relationships with communities and you have done a lot of ethno-graphical work as well as interviews and so on. Is there anything in particular that you always keep in mind, when you are doing interviews or building relationships?***

**Stiphany:** Data is, for anyone, very abstract particularly for community members are community partners. For me, it's (data's) translation or synthesis into forms that concretely improve everyday life , in the short and long term that's the goal. It is one thing to create any unprecedented data set, we can write binders about it, go to the U.N, but there is a very everyday reality that must be accounted for when your are dealing with any project, in this case a data project. The second issue is the ownership of the data. Many times we have been studying Latin America for decades, if you look at Janis Pearlman's pioneering project, I think  that it is really important that community partners feel a sense of ownership over their own data. They know how to access the tool, that they know what it means, that the variables are variables that have meaning to them. Those variables have come from workshops and  discussions where we asked 'what do you want to see? '. We had 170 questions, that is 20 years worth of data. What is the most important things that they are working on right now? So data ownership is a key issue.

***I also want to know the challenges and obstacles that you are facing right now. This project is growing and is really fascinating but there should be something really difficult as part of it.***

**Stiphany:** I think that there is this myth that data is infinitely malleable and that it connects an infinite number of people and places but you still have to have a person who is interested in managing the process and shepherds the process on a regular basis. You can't be in 20 different places at once, so managing the extent to which you can troubleshoot over telephone or skype or actually having to go to Sao Paulo, those kinds of travel arrangements and those kinds of logistics are challenging to maintain.

***It takes time.***

**Stiphany:** Yeah, it takes time and you know that being a migrant. One of the things that Star talks about relative to infrastructures, to digital infrastructures, is that it is not the what of infrastructure. We know data for development is a pull on NECK but it is an interesting idea but its the when. I think that currently Brazil is in the apex of a very deep political and economical crisis and so their issues are quite immediate and the extent to which citizens in informal settlements are really resisting the removal of their homes as broader forces when there is a lack of state oversight and data really can't change that. Data will not change the extent to which those forces exist but it can influence decision making processes among community members so they understand why they are doing it. They are leveraging for projects that have meaning for them.

***Speaking of data, I participated in a lot of sessions and discussions about data and XXXX but I get a feeling that most of them are talking as data and that it is data for data's sake. Not really as data as a set of information, there is not human experience attached to it and that was one of the main reasons why I liked your project is because it always combined this ethnographic research and everyday reality. Data is coming from there, data is not something that appears out of no-where and is cold and that you can't analyse it.***

**Stiphany:** There is a grain and scale of data that one can capture by doing field work and doing collaborative field work that is impossible through remote sensing. I am writing an article now about what remote sensing captures relative to the same communities which we captured. That reminds me of another challenge, when we are doing field work and working with community partners they have all these layered stories about they don't fit into these containers of the survey, they don't fit into these containers of data and so there are all these moments of divergence and convergence between the process of collecting data and the experience of living in these places. This is another challenge that we are always trying to mitigate and deal with. One of the things we do is we make small films, where we use voice and narratives for community members to compliment the cold data sets with narratives and stories. It is one way in which we are beginning to really deepen the data collection process.

***There is a diversion in the ways of collecting data, presenting the data, documenting the data. How do you make sure of the accuracy of data because it is not just you collecting it.***

**Stiphany:** Mrs. Kristine Stiphany: That was a big issue so I am glad you brought it up. I dealt with that through – random selection set the tone that we were not just going to be talking to friends. It still required the reduction to 1 person within the team that actually dealt with the data input. One was a masters of architecture and urban design from Berkeley, myself and an architectural student from Sao Paulo. So we had 2 Americans who had lived there and third was my student who I had taught previously. We constrained the data input and the question asking to those 3 individuals.

***That can be a challenging process.***

**Stiphany:** In the beginning we did do another way to make the process more inclusive. This was a two part questionnaire. There was the qualtrix part that was via an iPad and its where the interviewer is just asking questions, it is essentially a post-dec of XXXX of XXXX analysis. It is all about observation. The second part was undertaken by community partners, where they are measuring things, they are observing things, they might be saying that 'this is in a bad part of town' for me this is on a quality level between 0 and 5.  They made theirs a little be more experiential, more qualitative but it was a series of 60 questions related to just observation and that permitted them to also make very qualitative notes like ' This is my aunt' or ' I see this person all the time, they have more rental properties' and so that kind of data is something that we would never be able to pick up but they picked it up through observation of architectural elements, understanding the situation in the community and know-how.


***I think that it is also quite important to think about who you are asking the questions to, who are the interviewees.***

**Stiphany:** We did have very high response rates. Part of it was having a website. The two communities are very different. One is 11km in the centre and the other is 22km. The 22km one is very urban. They were much more vulnerable and the people were much more dubious of what was going on. We used the website more in the peripheral areas to say 'This is a legitimate entity' but across the board we interviewed mostly women because in those situations primarily women were the ones at home, about 90% of the respondents were woman. We had a very high response rate, something like 80%.

Mariko: Wow! That is very high!

**Stiphany:** My advisor, Peter Ward, did a similar study in Mexico in the 1970's and said to be prepared –   I don't know if it is because we were an all female team we had 1 male in the inner core community. I don't know if it is because we did our interviews at night, we would start at around 5pm, we would be walking around in the evening. We would have a lot of interviews with women over dinners with women cooking. I think that they were more prepared to let us in because we were 3 women, a mix of Americans and Brazilians. There was something about it that worked. We had many women come up to us and tell us that there was something going on, I wouldn't come back for a week if I were you. We were helped along the entire 8 months tremendously. We were very lucky in that sense, very lucky. We a couple of incidents where a man came home and the woman was answering questions about the home and it made him angry and he kicked the team out, that happened a couple of times in the more peripheral settlements. Other than that, we did not have any problems in terms of access. There were times when they wanted to see if we had business cards or a website and  I think that word started to get around that we were there and because it took so long people started to get an understanding that there is a group of women walking around with iPads and they are fine.



***All the design work and engineering work was done in the team? Do you have a design team or an engineering team?***

**Stiphany:** That is not as collaborative as I would like it to be. Its taken place mostly after the formal completion of the grant and through the data analysis process. The first thing we did was to use the data to identify vulnerable areas in the community. In one of the communities, we then developed a series of 3 future scenarios based on what the communities indicated would be interesting. Whether it was mass housing, all formal housing or a mix. We developed volume metric scenarios based on those scenarios. The idea was then to take it back to the communities in August. But at this point there is a lack of connection between that translation to design, its presentation to a global audience and its vetting by community partners.

That is something that I am hoping the website can do moving forward. We are unfunded at this point, as of last September. The idea of creating in Chapa Studio is to begin to structure a social enterprise whereby we begin to funnel money back into the research part. So we can , maybe through crowdfunding, to develop small projects in the community that are concrete and reflective of the COMMUNITY.

***There is a lot to come.***

**Stiphany:** IThere's a lot to come. What other projects are you working on or writing about? Or are you focusing on a particular set of projects?

Mariko: So when I was in university I was focusing on my XXXXX I was doing research on multicultural planning especially in the northern parts of Europe, like Sweden and Denmark. I was living in Copenhagen and Mamo; a town just 30 mins away from Copenhagen. I XXXX 4 years and XXXX doing interviews everyday because the XXXX are under reconstruction and redevelopment right now because the government wanted to have diverse neighbourhoods with friendly migrants but I was hesitant about it as I have a multicultural planning sensibility. In the end, its not just about having this diversity but who are you making this diversity for? It is really easy to have this concept of beautiful diversity all packaged up with sugar on top.

This was my topic and after coming back from Europe to Japan, I continued to do research in the Japanese context and it was completely different than Europe and was really interesting. But I was working full-time for a design/research firm so I was doing this full time job and it was not directly related to my research, it was more a personal project.

For this journey, for this clip, I also wanted to focus on inclusive design and diversity issues. It is closely related to yours and that is why I am interested in your project.  Austin was my first city and this is the second and so I am just going to keep bobbling around talking to people. I have heard a lot about Portland and Toronto. I have heard some reports of diversity and multicultural planning there so I am really looking forward to going there and meeting new people.

 **Stiphany:** I think this idea of diversity planning, XXXX talks about, she has been very influential in my work, invented spaces of participation and then invited spaces of participation. Chapa is really interested in this idea of creating platforms in which people can invent places of participation. Brazil in particular have had these massive redevelopment projects since the 1980's which created significant churn but also created community cohesion in many ways but the participatory processes are very weak and its hard, I get it, I have seen it first hard. I think its very hard to ask architects and urban designers to create these participatory projects when they have no budget. They have a week to turn around an entire project, and so I think there is an inordinate amount of blame put on them for doing things that they have not been given the budget or the training to do. I see technology as a way to bridge some of those gaps, not all of them, but to begin to help decision making processes between communities, designers and governments. I think that what Chapa started out as and I hope that it will evolve in a way to do that with Chapa Studio XXXX.

**Stiphany:** Chapa Studio is really interested in bridging this gap between diversity and planning, urban design and governments. Using data to inform design, not to drive it, not to determine it. I don't believe that data is the SUPERPILL, technology is not the SUPERPILL.

***Sort of like magnets that connect all the dots between architects, designers, communities and governments.***

**Stiphany:** We are starting small with Chapa Studio to see what happens and then expanding Chapa Urban Lab to encompass other researchers, one who is working on the border of Texas and Mexico. Another who is working on shrinking cities in Brazil. Brazil has experienced reverse migration, and also a proliferation of these small cities that are growing in the middle of nowhere. Often, their entire urban cores are invulnerable. Brazil has these very participatory federal processes which is based on the fed's right to the city. These small cities are obligated to account for that legislation but they literally do not have the tools to do so. They literally do not have a map of the city. One of our collaborators, she is situated in Brazil and she takes boats up the Amazon to these cities  and making maps with citizens so that the local governments at least have something.

**Stiphany:** So that is what Chapa Urban Labs is expending. What are the different forms of urbanism that are beginning to appear through these very emergent forms of politics?

We deal with situated data, Donna Haroway talks a lot about situated knowledge and the extent to which data becomes situated means that people can begin to take responsibility for the data so that it isn't some abstract thing. This idea of responsibility and understanding – Haroway also talks about having this god-fear of remote-sensing XXXX the extent of which it's impossible and do we want it anyway. I don't think it has gotten us anywhere anyway, in terms of planning. At the same time, incrementalism is a little too small and somehow trying to bring those together.

**Stiphany:** II think I have also experienced that position in Brazil, always being an outsider but in many ways, Sao Paulo feels like home more than any other place for me. Its where I feel most comfortable, I have an office there, I have all the things, for me, that complete everyday life are contained within Sao Paulo. Trying to go between the United States and Brazil has been, in many ways, for me a way to de-familiarise both. I became interested in politics and the political dimensions of planning through Brazil, I wasn't interested in it before but now I am, just through the lens of Brazil.

This position now for me, being a female in an informal settlement, changes things, it fundamentally changes things. I can never be a fly on the wall and I am not going to pretend to. Its more honest to say 'yes we have these differences so lets talk about them' .
