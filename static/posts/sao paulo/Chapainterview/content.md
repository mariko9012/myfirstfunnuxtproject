In February 2018 I attended the [World Urban Forum 9 (WUF9)](http://wuf9.org/) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was a place to take part in an active exchange of ideas as well as the best urban practices in the world, and this is where I got to know about the project called [Chapa](www.chapa.io),which means "urban guide" in Portuguese).

There was a session during WUF9 about citizen-sourced data and participatory technologies, organized in collaboration with the Latin American Housing Network (LAHN), based at the University of Texas at Austin, and Chapa, an urban laboratory for citizen-sourced data in São Paulo, Brazil. They have been gathering data through a large-scale household survey in São Paulo's informal communities.

They had a great discussion about Big Data and citizen participation, uniquely forming connections between technology, participation, and housing production in the fields of public policy, urban planning, and architecture.

*Chapa: Research at the Intersection of Housing and Technology in Brazilian Informal Settlements*

Few months later, I had the honor of meeting Kristine Stiphany, a founder and director of Chapa, in Lubbock, Texas, to get to know more about the project.

***Thank you very much for your time today. First of all, could tell me a bit more about your background and your relationship with South America?***

**Stiphany:** I travelled in Latin America prior to graduating from school and was in Brazil for quite some time. During the stay, I ended up meeting my mentor, who is a sociologist and dean of an architecture school in São Paolo. She showed me what architecture and urbanism in Latin America is all about.

I learned a lot from her, about actually understanding what people want and how they actually live in Brazil. There was a neighborhood where the residents had been constructing buildings by themselves over the years, after a developer had abandoned it. I started documenting the community.

I was there for a year, and then I went to graduate school in architecture.

### The idea of informality

***During your presentation in WUF9, I understood that the idea of "informality" is one of the key themes of your research. Could you explain what informality means in this context?***

**Stiphany:** Yes. A few years later I went back to São Paulo and lived in a neighborhood with a very small community of around 500-550 families, in the northeastern sector of São Paulo. Within that trajectory I started to focus on the *idea of informality*.

**Stiphany:** I started studying this community by interviewing the residents in order to understand the built environment -- investigating from where they got their materials to construct their houses and their relationships with social networks.

After a year, I saw that their neighborhood was being torn down to make way for a new development project. The fluidity and the extent to which those processes were created over time that I had learned about were wiped all out by the government in a very short period of time, and this resonated deeply with me.

I then went on to do a PhD focusing on re-development, this interface between broad structural issues and the agency of individuals and the agency of communities, how those come together in very messy ways. For me, that’s really where the potential for urban design lies.

I ethnographically studied two larger communities over the next 5 years, and was fortunate enough to have that project funded by the National Science Foundation. They also funded a post-doc to study the same communities quantitatively. That’s when my research took a turn. It started to become less about my observations and began to really include creating platforms through which others could take agency.

That is where the technology part comes in.

### Participatory technology and data

***I see. Could you tell me how participatory technology comes in?***

**Stiphany:** I am interested in technology and to the extent to which it de-familiarises us with the city and things that we think we are familiar with. I started that exploration as a photographer doing undergraduate in fine arts. I didn't speak Portuguese at first, so technology was a way to communicate.

The project is really about helping citizens, communities and governments to design their futures using technology. The project has two main goals: *one is to create this new database, to understand what is there rather than wiping out the settlements before you make design decisions*, instead of returning things to a modernist ideology. *The second is expanding the scope of architecture to include questions of infrastructure and how it can start to be something that is more socially and technically situated within the realities of the formality.*

Another thing that was important about the data is that in São Paulo, like many cities around the world but especially in the global south, they are being allotted, and rightly so, to the mapping of informality and formality, so we understand not only where informality is happening.

*Chapa's primary goal was to get a much finer grain of data at the block level, at the lot level, and at the level of the individual*. It is really about *the human experience*. There is a translation into design, which is what we have been focused on over the past year.

I think Chapa is an opportunity to create new connections between architecture and urbanism. It encompasses the bio-physical challenges that are inherent to any informal situation. I think 60% of slums or favelas in São Paulo or in Brazil are situated around a water source, so that is one issue. The other issue that we are getting into is health and the extent to which informal settlements have differing health problems. The platform started as something about the built-in environment and how certain social or family situations evolve. It has now become something about the broader issues of health, bio-physical processes, and environmentalism in the city related to the condition of informality and post-industrialisation.

We are looking for broader scales of impact and are now working on a corridor that begins to encompass one of the case studies and a string of small informal communities in the same area. We are using scenario planning to analyse different ways to structure the future of informality; that’s what we are interested in, so that it is not a full cleanout and it’s not just doing nothing.

One of the reasons why this is important in São Paulo and Brazil is that, recently, there has been a shift away from upgrading. Since the 1980s, the governments in Latin America have upgraded and improved informal settlements, and they are now saying it is too fussy, that they are returning the mass peripheral housing. Like Mia Casa, Mia Vida, Mexico has Invo na vi, and Chile also does it. Kuma no davos is a social emancipation tool so that citizens have access to their own data, and it is a way to link architecture and urbanism, it’s a way to inform urban design decisions, but it’s also a way to resist this broader neglect of informal settlements that have been consolidated in poor areas over the past three to four decades.

###

***Is there anything in particular that you always keep in mind when you are doing interviews or building relationships with local communities?***

**Stiphany:** Data is, for anyone, very abstract -- particularly for community members and community partners.For me, *it's data translation or synthesis into forms that concretely improve everyday life*; in the short and long term, that's the goal.

It is one thing to create an unprecedented dataset. We can write binders about it, go to the U.N., but there is a very everyday reality that must be accounted for when you are dealing with any project, in this case a data project.

The second issue is *the ownership of the data*. We have been studying Latin America for decades, and I think that it is really important that community partners feel a sense of ownership over their own data.

That they know how to access the tool, that they know what it means, that the variables are variables that have meaning to them...Those variables have come from workshops and  discussions where we asked 'What do you want to see?'. We had 170 questions.That is 20 years worth of data.

### The myth around data

***I also want to know the challenges and obstacles that you are facing right now. This project is growing and is really fascinating, but there should be something really difficult that is part of it.***

**Stiphany:** I think that there is this myth that data is infinitely malleable and that it connects an infinite number of people and places, but you still have to have a person who is interested in managing the process and who shepherds the process on a regular basis. You can't be in 20 different places at once, so managing the extent to which you can troubleshoot over the telephone or Skype or actually have to go to Sao Paulo, those kinds of travel arrangements and those kinds of logistics are challenging to maintain.

***It takes time.***

**Stiphany:** Yeah, it takes time.

Also, I think that currently Brazil is at the apex of a very deep political and economical crisis and so their issues are quite immediate and the extent to which citizens in informal settlements are really resisting the removal of their homes are broader forces, whereby there is a lack of state oversight and the data really can't change that. Data will not change the extent to which those forces exist, but it can influence decision making processes among community members so that they understand why they are doing it. They are leveraging for projects that have meaning for them.

The first challenge is that when we are doing fieldwork and working with community partners they have all these layered stories about how they don't fit into these containers of the survey, all these containers for the data, and so there are all these moments of divergence and convergence between the process of collecting data and the experience of living in these places. This is another challenge that we are always trying to mitigate and deal with. One of the things we do is we make small films, where we use voices and narratives for community members to complement the cold datasets with narratives and stories. This is one way in which we are beginning to really deepen the data collection process.

***There is a diversion in the ways of collecting data, presenting the data, documenting the data. How do you ensure the accuracy of the data? ***

**Stiphany:** That was a big issue, so I am glad you brought it up.

I dealt with that through random selection and set the tone that we were not just going to be talking to friends. It still required the reduction to one person within the team that actually dealt with the data input. One was a masters of architecture and urban design from Berkeley, one was myself, and one was an architectural student from São Paulo. So we had two Americans who had lived there and the third was my student whom I had taught previously. We constrained the data input and the question asking to those three individuals.

In the beginning, we did go another way to make the process more inclusive. This was a two-part questionnaire. There was the Qualtrics part, which was via an iPad, and it is where the interviewer was just asking questions.

The second part was undertaken by community partners, where they are measuring things, observing things, or they might be saying that 'this is in a bad part of town’ or ‘for me this is on a quality level between 0 and 5’. They made their measurements a little be more experiential, more qualitative, but it was a series of 60 questions related to just observation, and that permitted them to also make very qualitative notes like 'this is my aunt' or 'I see this person all the time, they have more rental properties' and so that kind of data is something that we would never be able to pick up, but they picked it up through observation of the architectural elements, understanding the situation in the community, and know-how.

***I think that it is also quite important to think about who you are asking the questions to, who are the interviewees.***

**Stiphany:** We did have very high response rates.

The two communities are very different. One is 11km in the centre and the other is 22km. The 22km one is very urban. They were much more vulnerable and the people were much more dubious of what was going on. We used the website more in the peripheral areas to say 'This is a legitimate entity', but across the board we interviewed mostly women because in those situations primarily women were the ones at home, about 90% of the respondents were woman. We had a very high response rate, something like 80%.

***That is very high!***

**Stiphany:**  I don't know if this is because we did our interviews at night; we would start at around 5pm, so we would be walking around in the evening. We would have a lot of interviews with women over dinners, with women cooking. I think that they were more prepared to let us in because we were 3 women, a mix of American and Brazilian. There was something about it that worked. We had many women come up to us and tell us that there was something going on, saying, ‘I wouldn't come back for a week if I were you’. We were helped along the entire eight months tremendously. We were very lucky in that sense, very lucky.

The first thing we did was to use the data to identify vulnerable areas in the community. In one of the communities, we then developed a series of three future scenarios based on what the communities indicated would be interesting. Whether it was mass housing, all formal housing or a mix. We developed volume metric scenarios based on those scenarios.

***What's next?***

**Stiphany:** We are starting small with Chapa Studio to see what happens and then expanding Chapa Urban Lab to encompass other researchers.

Brazil has experienced reverse migration, and also a proliferation of these small cities that are growing in the middle of nowhere. Often, their entire urban cores are invulnerable. Brazil has these very participatory federal processes which are based on the Fed's right to the city. These small cities are obligated to account for that legislation, but they literally do not have the tools to do so.

What are the different forms of urbanism that are beginning to appear through these very emergent forms of politics?  That is what Chapa Urban Labs is expounding.

***Thank you so much for your time today!***
