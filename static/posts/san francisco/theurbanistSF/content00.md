It is also very special to meet a fellow urbanist and flâneurian from different cities. Because I can asure you, that they are the most tremendous guides who let you experience a city in a way that none of the other city guide can.

Nate Mahoney is an urbanist and UX researcher, who focus on Human Centric design and experience of cities.

Grew up in a suburb and get to travel everywhere with a car, he started to walk intensely when he made a move to San Francisco.

[The Urbanist SF](http://www.theurbanistsf.com/) has a super exciting [San Francisco Kit](https://squareup.com/market/urbanist-sf/pedestrian-essentials-tote), which is everything we need to explore the city. I love the idea of having a starter kit for newcomers to the city, which is packed with all the passion/knowledge/love of the urbanist!

I had an great oppotunity to join this tour with Nate and this post is to invite you to the beautity of *Flâneur* and human centred city.

exibit design
I did some exibit in some stores to tell the history of stores
One of the store is in Castro - one of Harvey Milk's camera store. So I did an intervention in that store to do a exibition based on human centric design
It was all about cities, how do you experience the cities. I think this is sort of an continuation of what I'm doing now.



What is Yan Ghel doing is very human centric
