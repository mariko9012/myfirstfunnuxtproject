[The Urbanist SF](http://www.theurbanistsf.com/) has a super exciting [San Francisco Kit](https://squareup.com/market/urbanist-sf/pedestrian-essentials-tote), which is everything we need to explore the city. I love the idea of having a starter kit for newcomers to the city, which is packed with all the passion/knowledge/love of the urbanist!
