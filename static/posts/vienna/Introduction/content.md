### Things to do, places to go

1. An art & cultural center in the bread factory — [Brotfabrik](http://www.brotfabrik.wien/en/home.html). Perfect example for an adaptive reuse without being too touristic.

2. [Das Packhaus](http://www.daspackhaus.at/): The temporary use project and Vienna’s largest startup hub.

3. Between 1918 and 1934, Vienna was ruled by the [Social Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Austria) government and they launched an extraordinary campaign to provide housing for working-class residents. Visit [Karl Marx Hof](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/27/vienna-karl-marx-hof-architecture-politics-ideology-history-cities-50-buildings) and [the museum in the laundry room](http://dasrotewien-waschsalon.at/startseite/)!
