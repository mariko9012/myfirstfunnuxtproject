### Things to do, places/project to check out

- If you are an urbanist you would love maps too. [Metsker Maps of Seattle](http://www.metskers.com/) is considered to be the largest map store in the U.S.

- Visit [Friends Of Waterfront Seattle](http://www.friendsofwaterfrontseattle.org/) to learn more about the waterfront urban development in Seattle.

### Read

- [Curbed Seattle](https://seattle.curbed.com/) is always informative fun platform to check out.

- Watch [10 parks that changed America](http://www.pbs.org/ten-that-changed-america/season-1/episode-3/) and two of them are in Seattle!

### Organization, initiative

- [Space.City](http://www.spacecityseattle.org/) is an independent, not-for-profit organization dedicated to the discussion of art, architecture and urbanism. I participated one of their event during the stay in Seattle, in which they invited [Maurice Cox](https://www.architectmagazine.com/design/maurice-coxs-detroit_o) from Detroit to discuss the urban dynamics that is happening in Detroit.

- [The Urbanist](https://www.theurbanist.org/) is a non-profit organization that serves to examine and influence urban policies, and they have a bunch of quite interesting articles to read online. They also organize educational events / workshops to invite everyone to discuss the future of cities.

- [AIA Seattle](https://www.aiaseattle.org/) is the architecture community based in Seattle.
