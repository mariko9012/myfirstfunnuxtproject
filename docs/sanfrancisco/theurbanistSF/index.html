	<article class="markdown" data-v-9e5686de><section><h1>Walk, Listen, and learn - an insight from The Urbanist San Francisco tour</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago I finally had the great opportunity to join a tour that I’ve been following online for a long time - <a href="http://www.theurbanistsf.com/" target="_blank">The Urbanist SF</a>. Of course, there are countless tours out there you can choose in a big city like San Francisco, but I’m telling you — this tour is not like the other tours, and you will see the city in a completely different way afterward. First of all, <a href="http://www.theurbanistsf.com/">The Urbanist SF</a> has a super exciting <a href="https://squareup.com/market/urbanist-sf/pedestrian-essentials-tote">Welcome to San Francisco Kit</a>, which contains some essential items for all the city lovers and urban explorers who want to discover the essence of the place.</p>
<p>What do you expect in a Welcome to San Francisco Kit? You can find a beautiful map illustrated by a local designer (I’m a map maniac and I’m quite sure that you can’t find this kind of map in a regular bookstore or souvenir shops), a handmade slim wallet made out of a map, a reusable water bottle to enjoy the delicious tap water in San Francisco, delicious almond snacks from a local market… and a lot more! The kit is filled with local charm, and you can listen to the background of each item and the story of the creators while walking around the city and paying attention to the daily life of a neighborhood with Nate Mahoney, a great urbanist.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF01.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>Nate Mahoney, the founder of The Urbanist SF</em></p>
<p>Nate Mahoney is an urbanist and UX researcher who focuses on Human-Centric design and the experience of cities.</p>
<p>Having grown up in the suburbs and traveling everywhere by car, he started to walk intensely when he made a move to San Francisco. In grad school, he encountered the concept of <em>Flâneur</em> and immediately fell in love with it. It made so much sense to him because he was already doing it — walking around the city to experience, to learn, to be… not necessarily to get point A from point B.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF03.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a pedestrian, he also started talking with people — fellow pedestrians and locals — and started to look at their lives and their stories. This is how the prototype of ​​this project was born. Each item within the kit is created in collaboration with local designers and brands whom he encountered during his Flâneuring, and each item is the crystallization of their stories, their beauty.</p>
<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of <em>Flâneur</em> — a literary concept developed by Baudelaire in 19th-century Paris. It’s been my secret guide whenever I want to immerse myself in cities. Thus, it is very special to meet a fellow urbanist and flâneurian from different cities, because in my opinion they are the most tremendous guides, helping you deeply touch the texture of a city.</p>
<h3>Walking in the Mission, with special items</h3>
<p>Highlighted in an hour’s tour is the Mission district, originally known as “the Mission lands”. San Francisco was founded on that spot by a Spanish Franciscan monk in 1776, which makes it the oldest district in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF05.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s also famous for many artists living in the neighborhood and beautiful murals that can be found everywhere in the district. While the cost of living is relatively cheaper compared to the other partd of San Francisco, this district has not been an exception to all the urban development and gentrification. However, the district still manages to keep its local charm and dynamics.</p>

<p>Below, I will walk through some of the highlights from the tour. It all felt special, especially when I was holding the items from the kit and listening to the great stories told by Nate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philz_Coffee" target="_blank">Philz coffee</a><br>
Philz coffee, opened in 2002, is an important local café that made a major contribution to the Bay Area’s third wave coffee boom. They have built a very strong relationship with the local community. Currently, it expanded its brand throughout the city, but the original store in the Mission district still has an important meaning.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/guide-san-francisco%E2%80%99s-mission-district-murals" target="_blank">Murals</a><br>
You can find a lot of murals at Balmy Alley, Clarion Alley, and the Women’s building. If you’re lucky, you can also find an artist on that spot, live painting.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.colpapress.com/pages/about" target="_blank">Colpa press</a><br>
A local print shop that publishes independent magazines and books. They also have galleries and hold workshops as a platform to support local artists.<br>
I highly recommend to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/wR3PSISQy5o" target="_blank">Nate’s interview</a> at the print shop.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF14.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The illustration map contained from the Kit was printed in this print shop. It was designed by a local artist <a href="https://www.carissapotter.com/" target="_blank">Carissa Potter</a> and I fell in love with her project <a href="https://www.peopleiveloved.com/">People I’ve loved</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuk2" target="_blank">Timbuk2</a><br>
Nate’s favorite! Timbuk2, a local bag brand founded in 1989, has great, high-quality products, and I enjoyed visiting their factory shop.</li>

<li><a href="https://womensbuilding.org/the-mural/" target="_blank">The Women’s building</a><br>
Founded in 1971, The Women’s building is the first community center operated by women in San Francisco. All the exterior of the building is covered with murals.</li>

<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF28.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Dolores_Park" target="_blank">Dolores Park</a><br>
The final spot of the tour was Dolores Park - everyone’s favorite! From this small hilly park between the Mission district and Neu Valley district, you can overlook the cityscape of San Francisco.<br>

<h3>Human-centric design for cities, and the beauty of walking around</h3>
<p><img src="/posts/sanfrancisco/theurbanistSF/resized/theurbanistSF19.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small for such a dynamic city, San Francisco’s irreverent spirit is threaded into every neighborhood. Rich in history, the culture of San Francisco has always been a reflection of its pride, its fearlessness and its need to be seen and heard. San Francisco has a kaleidoscope of urban appeal, a place for adventure, delicacy and creature comforts. - from <a href="http://www.theurbanistsf.com/" target="_blank">official website</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nate cares a lot about the experience and livability of our cities — cities for people. It takes a lot of time and effort to prepare a tour like this, because it requires a ton of research about how people live in cities and how they interact with their urban environment. The most important thing is to walk around the city and listen to the stories from people, and to discover the charm of the place and find collaborators on your own two feet. This tour teaches us that.</p>
<p>In the future, he is planning to spread this project to the other big cities in the U.S. such as Los Angeles and New York. I highly recommend The Urbanist SF to all city lovers.</p>

目的もなく歩き回ることで、都市を経験し、学ぶことを繰り返してきました。</p>\n<p><img src="theurbanistSF03.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF04.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>そんななか、地元の人々の生活や物語に目を向けはじめ、彼らと話はじめた結果、このプロジェクトのアイディアの原型が生まれます。サンフランシスコの街をよりローカルに楽しむための「アーバニストキット」のアイテム１つ１つは、地元のデザイナーやブランドとコラボレーションしたもの。それぞれを手に取りながら街を歩くことで、地元のローカルなストーリーに耳を傾けることができます。</p>\n<h3>「アーバニストキット」を手に歩く、ミッション地区</h3>\n<p>１時間のツアーでハイライトされたのは、歴史的にヒスパニック系住民が多く住むミッション地区。サンフランシスコは、1776年にスペイン人のフランシスコ会修道士によって創立されましたが、このミッション地区がその始まり。サンフランシスコ市内で最も古い地区です。</p>\n<p><img src="theurbanistSF05.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF06.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>アーティストの多いエリアでもあり、屋外壁画などが有名でもあります。北部のダウンタウンに比べて比較的物価は安いものの、昨今は人気上昇のため、住民やショップの入れ替わりなど大きく変化している地区です。</p>\n<p>サンフランシスコのほぼ全ての地区を歩き回ったMahoney氏は、最終的にミッション地区を選んだ理由を「この地区には面白いことが自然と多いから」と説明します。街歩きをしているなかで、面白いと思ったお店に飛び込んだり、地元の人にインタビューをすることで、じわじわとコラボレーターを見つけ、キットに入れるアイテムを１つ１つ検討していきました。</p>\n<p><img src="theurbanistSF07.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF13.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>以下、ツアーで訪れたミッション地区の面白いスポットをいくつか紹介します。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philz_Coffee">Philz coffee</a><br>\n2002年にオープンしたPhilz coffeeは、ベイエリアのサードウェーブ・コーヒーブームに大きく貢献した重要なローカルカフェ。古いマーケットを改修し、定期的にコミュニティイベントなどを開催することで、地元コミュニティと非常に強い関係を築いてきたと言います。現在はサンフランシスコ中に店舗を拡大したものの、元祖であるミッション地区のPhilz coffeeは、今でも重要な意味を持っているとのことです。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="http://www.sftravel.com/article/guide-san-francisco%E2%80%99s-mission-district-murals">屋外壁画</a><br>\nBalmy Alley、Clarion Alley他、後に紹介するWomen’s buildingでもアーティストの巨大な屋外壁画を楽しむことができます。<br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF08.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF09.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF10.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF11.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF12.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF21.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF22.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF23.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://www.colpapress.com/pages/about">Colpa press</a><br>\nミッション地区に位置する、インディペントのマガジンやブックを出版する小さなプリントショップ。地元のアーティストを支援するプラットフォームとして、ギャラリーやワークショップの開催なども行なっています。Mahoney氏がこのプリントショップで行なったインタビューは、<a href="https://youtu.be/wR3PSISQy5o">Youtube</a>で確認することができます。<br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF14.jpg" alt=""><br>\nここのプリントショップでは、「アーバニストキット」に入っているイラストレーションマップが印刷されました。デザインは、地元のアーティスト<a href="https://www.carissapotter.com/">Carissa Potter</a>さん。彼女のプロジェクトの１つである<a href="https://www.peopleiveloved.com/">People I’ve loved</a>のイラストレーションは必見です。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuk2">Timbuk2</a><br>\n1989年に創立のバックの地元ブランド、Timbuk2はMahoney氏のお気に入り。訪れた店舗兼工房は必見です。<br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF15.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF16.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF17.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://womensbuilding.org/the-mural/">The Women’s building</a><br>\n1971年に創立したThe Women’s buildingは、サンフランシスコで初めて女性によって運営されたコミュニティ・センター。建物の外観は、全てアーティストの屋外壁画に覆われています。<br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF28.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Dolores_Park">Dolores Park</a><br>\nツアーの締めくくりはサンフランシスコの定番、ミッション・ドロレス公園。ミッション地区とノイバレー地区に挟まれた小高い丘にある公園で、サンフランシスコの街並みを一望することができます。公園の芝生に寝そべって、ピクニックをしたりダンスをしたり、それぞれの時間を楽しむ人々。日本でも見てみたい風景です。<br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF30.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF31.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="theurbanistSF32.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>都市の人間中心デザインに向けて</h3>\n<p><img src="theurbanistSF19.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>サンフランシスコを10倍楽しむためのアイテムが詰まった「アーバニストキット」＆ツアー。今後は、ロサンゼルスやニューヨークなど、アメリカの他の大都市への展開も考えているそう。それでも一番大切なのは、とにかく街を歩くこと。その場所の物語に耳を傾けて、魅力を発見し、自分の足でコラボレーターを見つけること。「だからとても時間と労力がかかるんだよね」と笑いながら話すMahoney氏が大切にしているのは、私たち一人ひとりの都市における経験と住みやすさ、つまり都市の人間中心デザインです。</p>\n<p><img src="theurbanistSF02.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</section>\n'},title:"Walk, Listen, and learn -
