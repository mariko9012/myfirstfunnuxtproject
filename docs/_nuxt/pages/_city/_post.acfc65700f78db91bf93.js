First of all, please introduce yourself and what you’re currently doing.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> Using Japan as a base, I have taught at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University for the past 15 years. As space and environment designer, we conduct research on Urban Studies with the theme of public space and city movement. Until recently, I had been mainly involved with the academic side, but since the Tohoku Earthquake in March 2011 a big opportunity came along for me to get involved to understand the changes in society. I‘ve been involved in Tokyo-based architectural office <a href="http://frontofficetokyo.com/">Frontoffice Tokyo</a>, and <a href="http://mincoco.tasukeaijapan.jp/?p=15354">Tohoku Planning Forum</a>, a project run by an international organization Architecture For Humanity.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*M7qNrSAECDhwoUBy.png" alt="On the “Tohoku Planning Forum” website, you can check detailed information on who is doing what on the restoration in the Tohoku region using an interactive map."><em>On the “Tohoku Planning Forum” website, you can check detailed information on who is doing what on the restoration in the Tohoku region using an interactive map.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Please tell me more about the events after the earthquake.What’s the goal of Tohoku Planning Forum?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> As a designer, architect, urban planning expert, citizen mediator, facilitator, we’ve been coming up with ideas for forums and events. This has allowed the local citizens and specialists to discuss the restorations plans.</p>\n<p>Architects are familiar with their areas, but it often ends there. City planners, engineers and artists are also the same — they communicate amongst themselves and not with other specialists.</p>\n<p>Also there is still hierarchy in the field of city planning and architecture. Even if you do a talk event, people will say, “Oh, that great teacher will come.” When organizing these events I was very conscious about removing the hierarchy and letting anyone speak their opinion.</p>\n<p>By doing so, I think that will increase the number of, ‘Citizen Urbanist’.</p>\n<p>I am also currently planning on an art project using containers. The idea is to have a moveable exhibition that can go around the Tohoku region, but I’ll talk about this later on.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ArlbwVF1kD36DvuQ.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Urbanism is not boring.</h2>\n<p><em><strong>You used the word facilitator to explain about your work. As a facilitator, it is important to involve a range of people from new and different industries.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> That’s right, I think “translation”is what connects people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Could you explain more what you mean by translation?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> As an example, I often think of “translating city planning”. The material of the urban master plans in Japan look very boring and very hard to understand. If you have a network with creators, I think that you can “translate” these boring plans into more attractive things while creating a relationship between the specialists and the artists to get citizens involved a plan that is, ‘readable’ and ‘understandable’.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*X4XQhsvSox2G0OKn.jpg" alt="I was able to look at Dima’s planning of Shibuya that was published in 1996, it was easy to read even for non-specialists and the mapping was very attractive.

I was very satisfied with the word “translation” in the context of the city. There are a number of projects that connect the specialists and citizens, and one of my favorite one is called <a href="http://shibuyahack.com/">Shibuya Hack Project</a>. It focuses on connecting people from a range of different areas and local stake holders.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> This is a very important activity. We did something similar at <a href="http://place-making.org/projects/tokyo-transitions">Tokyo Transitions</a> in 2015. I feel these activities will increase the number of Citizen Urbanist.</p>\n<h2><strong>A focus on connecting person to person — Transition Design</strong></h2>\n<p><em><strong>Would you please tell me a little more about ‘Tokyo Transitions?’ Was your main focus on connecting person to person?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> Transition Design is a new area, recently Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh has made a program using this name. The climate is changing and the politics are unstable, I feel we are living in a period of ‘transition.’ In South East Asia and Africa a Neoliberal market is taking over the local markets and the refugees are crossing the Mediterranean. In this day of age, are the specialists and policymakers who don’t pay attention to these transitions allowed to make decisions on these grand designs?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*OPu9leduQqdgG5oV.png" alt="Tokyo transition (Spring 2015) was a week-long project aimed at everyone who lived in the city.

The aim was to portray what the city planners, facilitators and community were doing. ‘place/making’ photo by Egami Kenichiro.</em></p>\n<p>Based on ‘transition design,’ last year we recruited people domestically and undergoing the program, ‘Tokyo transitions.’ We walked around the city did talk about events and workshops for a week inviting artists and administrators and not just specialists. A day may look like, discussions at midday based on a particular theme at the talk event and then walk around Minami-Senju and Muko island. It is similar to what the secret club did for the ‘Shibuya Hack Project,’ but for this project, we used the secret messages to help us communicate with the locals and see the hidden spots we’ve missed in the area. From the information gathered we were able to create a mapping, do an exhibition and was able to do a big discussion.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*32x5RHxYb8H0Nhgp.png" alt="For Tokyo Transitions, we will be doing city walking, mapping, forums and three exhibitions.

The people involved won’t be just specialists by local artists and administrators. ‘Place/making,’ photo by Egami Kennichiro.</em></p>\n<p>The era when small experts make cities is over. Economists, psychologists, graphic designers, and citizens should collaborate with architects and planners to think of a design. The difficult part is specialists prefer specialists and they are creating a wall in their region to protect themselves.</p>\n<p><em><strong>That’s right. Many of the events can not be explained by just one particular field. You talked about facilitation, for an event like Tokyo Transitions the key seems to be creating connection across a range of fields.</strong></em></p>\n<h2>Working towards the three ‘translations’</h2>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> The way we are going to connect person to person is going to depend on who we connect with who. Therefore what I think is going to be important is a translator. A translator is going to be the key to this concept and there are 3 reasons why.</p>\n<p>First, like I’ve said, <strong>the bridge between specialists such as architects and city planners is going to be translators.</strong> Usually we don’t really think about it architects are architectures, geographers are maps, businesses are businesses, I think specialists keep to themselves in their own area of expertise. What we need is current of age is interdisciplinary, a flexible collaboration between different specialists.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>translating among languages and cultures.</strong> Obviously it is important to overcome the difference in language but especially in Japan where the ‘top’ city planners, architects or developers are waiting for an answer from the West. Without ignoring it, instead of just copying and pasting the example of the West, I think it is important to combine the flexible application with the Japanese context.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*VW3Rx9CNqMSry7Kz.jpg" alt="Through translation he is trying to connect regional actors, and facilitating the importance of networking."><em>Through translation he is trying to connect regional actors, and facilitating the importance of networking.</em></p>\n<p>The third is <strong>a bridge between translation of the citizen’s community and specialists.</strong> Using difficult languages, designs and maps is a way of losing the locals, in order to increase Urbanist citizens is simplify and make the design and arts created by specialists accessible, this is something loft work is good at.</p>\n<h2>”New Urban Commons”</h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*OUSn4fspTxny2TbH.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p><em><strong>I understand the concept of translation, it is truly something embodied by Tokyo Transitions.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> That’s right. On the last day of Tokyo Transition, Mr. Terai from <a href="https://madcity.jp/">Mad City</a> and Mr. Itou from <a href="http://www.shibaurahouse.jp/">Shibaura House</a> did the talks. Listening to the involvement of these people really gets me motivated. Telling people what to do, or this is the right way will not motivate people to take action. instead, listening to success stories I feel will create more of an impact.</p>\n<p>For example, Mr. Ito of Shibaura House, he was the one that changed a typical advertisement company into something new, and I think his road to success was full of failures, trial and errors. I think the story told by Mr.Ito will reach out to people at a personal level, be encouraging and an inspiration.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I’ve also read your paper on ‘new urban commons’. Could you explain a bit more about it?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer</strong> There is a concept called “commons”. It is a shared resource that everyone can access, and many discussions are done in social relations. In Japanese it is translated as iriai, but what I’m interested in the new area is, ‘new urban commons.’ For example, Shibaura House or where I’m living (<a href="http://www.collectivehouse.co.jp/">Kankan forest</a>) there are new communities around.</p>\n<p>What is distinctive about such urban new commons is that it is more open, unlike the traditional old closed community. It is necessary practice amongst new people coming and going. Shibaura House and Kankan forest communities are constantly evolving and performing, this won’t end and there is not final picture.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&quot;Practice&quot; is a perfect word to describe the commons, I think.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> Yes it is. Commons and communities wasn’t statically built. It was practiced, the point that is changes may be a better verb. The important part is updating inner community, values and rules and continuously being new and dynamic. If this flow ends then the commons will die out.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Based on what we talked about what do you think is important for the cities in Japan? You being post growth society and doing lectures on building a place post Tohoku Earth quake.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dimmer:</strong> I think we are heading toward a positive direction in terms of, ‘new urban commons,’ from new places being born like Shibaura House and Kankan forest. I am looking forward to the increasing strength of urban life, consideration towards the environment, DIY and share mentality in Japan which will create, new urban commons. However as stated, common is a living thing, through communication and workshops I feel we will need to continue these collaborative activities.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thank you so much for sharing your ideas today!</strong></em></p>\n<p>Christian Dimmer<br>\nAssistant professor of the international education department at Waseda University/ Space and Environment designer, urban researcher.</p>\n<p><em>(※This article was originally posted on <a href="http://layout.net/">layout.net</a>.

The term “urbanist” is not popularly used in the Japanese context, but I believe that what Japanese cities (particularly Tokyo) need in this age of rapid transformation is to go beyond “civil engineering” and the idea that the urban environment is the playground of merely architects and planners.</p>\n<h2>Urbanist MeetUp Tokyo</h2>\n<p>Cities are formed/imagined/lived and used by people from various backgrounds and with interests. The increasingly popular Japanese concept of “machi-zukuri” (community/neighborhood planning — check out this article<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0955580022000008745"> here</a>), for instance, means a departure from the traditional form of top-down planning and covers variety of fields, such as community development, renovation, regional branding, town development, real estate, geography, architecture, and more. Yes, there are tons of professions that are closely related to cities, not only architects and planners — so what is the meaning of connecting all these activities and professions on the horizontal axis?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KhR9gu4HI_5x8PeRTYHBdw.jpeg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZAcYtkmVfFvpKeTMaOXRag.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>2017 December in Tokyo; approximately 150 urbanists showed up to the meetup. The meetup was originally initiated by a few young architects from the renovation industry, who have been gathering and holding a party every year for the past 4 years in order to extend the narrow frame of the industry.</p>\n<p>Since then, the concept has spread not only among the renovation industry but also to real estate, architectural design, town planning and other areas. This time, we expanded the frame further and gathered a wide variety of people who were related to cities in various ways in order to create a more inviting and strong community — we decided to name it “Urbanist MeetUp”.</p>\n<p>In this meetup, the word “urbanist” was widely defined as “people who make/use/live cities”, and we invited 23 urbanists to give a short pitch about their activities — their approach and passion for cities. A small game followed to elicit conversation among participants.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this meetup was that there was a variety of professions involved — not only architects and planners, but also people from community development, writers and editors from the media covering a variety of urban issues, and IT engineers who are developing apps about cities. All the speakers and participants were able to meet others who are equally passionate about cities, but had totally different professions and approaches. If that doesn’t trigger a conversation towards brand-new ideas and inspiration, what will?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gcwsC6txM0SI0n27IsbWzQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*k8vmwM3oLRZ6Y5fy9l4pZQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Fireside Chat for cities@Tokyo</h2>\n<p>As another example , a few months ago my colleague and I organized a meetup called “Fireside Chat for Cities” . This was a meetup for urbanists to discuss various topics related to cities in an interactive manner. We gathered in a small bar on Shinjuku Golden Street, and the focus was a discussion of the subjective, personal stories of the participants.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*is3alF3-N-K-Vh7VAj2JJw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*XGsFsQo0HPG6aGr-53t0gQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>We came up with some random city-related themes such as “noise, crowded trains, staircases, drinking companions, convenience stores, windows, romance, smell, gender” , whereby each participant selected one of the themes and talked about what they had experienced regarding that topic in cities. The aim was to grasp our cities through the complexity of how one experiences and lives in a city and gets to know the others’ different approaches and opinions.</p>\n<p>Most of the participants were not architects or urban planners, but when they talked about their subjective memories and experiences of the cities, it really didn’t matter who “knew” the city better.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*CtGxKf36qMHkK5R5K4bmGA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*tdUbhqoxzQYirPzDuht5fg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Who is the “urbanist”?</h2>\n<p>In Japan, the word urbanism is often translated in association with urban planning and civil engineering skills, and in many cases it is considered that urbanist = urban planner. However, if the urbanist is grasped broadly as those people who “make” cities and “use/live” cities, we can bring together people from a wide variety of specialized fields, like those gathered in this meetup under the same term — even the citizens.</p>\n<p>The term urbanist is also becoming more and more acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Scott Bonjukian, a writer in<a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/01/19/why-i-call-myself-an-urbanist/"> The Urbanist,</a> published an article in 2016 called “<a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/01/19/why-i-call-myself-an-urbanist/">Why I call myself an urbanist</a>” in which he said that the English words “urbanism” and “urbanist” have recently become popular. He summaries that “<em>urbanists want more people (of all types) to have equal access to housing variety (apartments, townhouse, backyard cottages, houses, duplexes, etc.), more ways to get around (transit, walking, bicycling, ride-share, vanpool, etc.), more to see and do (parks, cafes, bars, museums, shops, etc.), and to have more grassroots influence on city government.</em>” He defines himself as one of them.</p>\n<p>In response to this article, Brandon Donnelly, an architectural blogger and creator, said: *“If you look it up in the dictionary, you’ll likely get something along the lines of: someone who is a specialist in city planning. But I bet that there are many people out there who would self-identity as being an urbanist, but who would also not consider themselves specialists in the field. The term has evolved to imply other things.“ *(Brandon Donnelly,<a href="http://brandondonnelly.com/post/137648883663/what-is-an-urbanist"> What is an urbanist?</a>)</p>\n<p>In addition, Christian Dimmer, who teaches urban studies at Waseda University in Tokyo, uses the word “citizen urbanists”, arguing that we citizens as the urban dwellers are the essence of the urbanist.</p>\n<h2>Urbanist in Tokyo</h2>\n<p>To sum up, I believe that those we call urbanists should not only be the “specialists” who make the physical environment of cities (like architects and city planners) but also other specialists and, most importantly, the citizens , who are participating in the urbanity.</p>\n<p>Japan is a country undergoing profound socio-economic and demographic transformation. Tokyo, specifically, is experiencing massive transformation with the very clear goal of hosting the Olympic Games in 2020. Looking at a map of prospective urban development of the whole city, you would be surprised at how many constructions are going on and how <em>similar</em> all these buildings are — all are concrete skyscrapers for fancy offices and hotels.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*18hAqZo_zfRi_y6OPOZrjw.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>While some are taking advantage of this economic boom, there have also been some very concerned voices about citizens’ rights to cities and urban commons. Some say that Tokyo is increasingly changing without the citizens’ will — its changes are based on developers’ money games.</p>\n<p>(If you want to know more about what’s happening, you can check out such research papers as “<a href="https://www.nri.com/~/media/PDF/global/opinion/papers/2015/np2015200.pdf">The need for rebuilding Tokyo with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as impetus</a>”.)</p>\n<p>I want to see more encouraging stories of people who participate and act in Japanese cities, not just of those who are imagined to be the stakeholders and responsible for making them.</p>\n</section>\n'},"43NH":function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h1>Design sprints for sustainable development goals: a recap from Global Goals Jam 2017 #Tokyo</h1>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*K1mn1ASdXth8VQYs1zMJ_w.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>On 16th-17th September 2017, I had the honor of hosting the first edition of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/globalgoalsjam">#GlobalGoalsJam</a> in Tokyo at 100BANCH. Global Goals Jam #Tokyo was a two-day event with short design sprints, using the methods from <a href="http://medialabamsterdam.com/">MediaLAB Amsterdam</a> — we invited various professionals, designers, creators, and students from more than 10 countries to share and develop our ideas.</p>\n<p>During the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2015/9/16/Around-the-world-the-Social-Good-Summit-celebrates-the-Global-Goals-.html">2015 Social Good Summit</a>, 193 world leaders committed to achieving <a href="http://www.globalgoals.org/">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> by the year 2030. As an initiative of the United Nations Development Program and MediaLAB Amsterdam, the Global Goals Jam began to design realistic, actionable interventions for these goals. Right now, there are more than 30 cities from different parts of the world supporting the initiatives from the local action.</p>\n<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/243070829" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>I met the co-founders Marco Van Hout and Gijs Gootjes when they came to Tokyo, and I had the honor of receiving an official invitation to be a local host for this incredible global event. This article invites you to get a glimpse at the first edition of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/globalgoalsjam">Global Goals Jam</a> #Tokyo.</p>\n<h2><strong>It’s actually very rare in Tokyo to have an event entirely in English, with people from various backgrounds.</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*_VGXsJBMAxLeDXTPksZrnw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>One thing I wanted to make happen was to make the event truly international and diverse. That means: it should welcome anyone regardless of their age, nationality, gender…. And it should be held in English.</p>\n<p>Tokyo is a big, global metropolis and — well, if you know OTHER big metropolises like New York and London, you might be surprised to know that the proportion of foreigners in Tokyo is surprisingly low. Thus, everyday contact with people from different cultural backgrounds is still a rare experience for most Japanese, especially for those who don’t feel comfortable speaking in English. In Global Goals Jam #Tokyo, I was pleased to see people from Japan, Canada, the USA, Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mauritius, etc. One of the participants from Mauritius told me that she has been looking for this kind of event in Tokyo for a long time.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter how well you speak English. What matters is working with someone from a different cultural background and exchanging opinions in a common language towards the same goal. Believe me, I know it can sometimes be very awkward and frustrating. But it’s worth it.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*OIjCrTzgzwT96UH01dmVHw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*2omWP-koPhB6NM2rT6deVA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*YhsufNauOkWwEpO1gnHoKg.jpeg" alt="David Willoughby from Workers University joined the event as one of the facilitators"><em>David Willoughby from <a href="http://www.workers-u.com/">Workers University</a> joined the event as one of the facilitators</em></p>\n<h2><strong>We learned the Design Sprints method from Amsterdam Media Lab.</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*tTl02fXIjQuZD0e5-7OrwQ.jpeg" alt="**Sprint #1 Organize it, experience it / Sprint #2 Respond to it**This was about identifying problems and organizing our ideas">***Sprint #1 Organize it, experience it / Sprint #2 Respond to it<br>\n*<em>This was about identifying problems and organizing our ideas</em></p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered what the heck a “design methodology” is? I know that it’s a fashionable thing to talk about “design” nowadays, but I always thought that many people didn’t really understand what it was, but just kinda wanted to talk bullshit about it.</p>\n<p>That’s why it was very valuable to use the concrete methods established by Amsterdam Media Lab. While leaving out the very fine details that actually fit into the local contexts, Amsterdam Media Lab provides a common language of design methods for the design field (they call it a mission to fight “design waste”), which is open and accessible and where even the beginners can dive straight in.</p>\n<p>Check out this <a href="https://medialabamsterdam.com/toolkit/">toolkit</a> — it has all the tools we can use, explaining each step that needs to be followed. It, of course, explains things like the process and for which purpose, how long it takes to complete a work, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*VwEDnJabc9MuNaX-68v8Bg.jpeg" alt="Day 2: Build it and test it"><em><strong>Day 2: Build it and test it</strong></em></p>\n<p>The second day was all about developing prototypes.

Below are some of the prototypes we developed during the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 1. 「Midori no Heroes」: Goal # 4 Quality Education</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*13H2_EEMvhG8RCWh1N2fsA.png" alt="『Midori no Heroes』Storyboard"><em>『Midori no Heroes』Storyboard</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: How to provide vocational education to encourage small farmers in Africa by sending them useful information via feature phones and smartphone?</p>\n<p>Their idea:“Midori no Heroes”, as a social entrepreneur, will partner with local research institutes, such as universities, central government and local government, to gather appropriate information for the farmers to farm better and more efficiently and then offer it to local small farmers. The team assumes that basic information such as weather forecasting can be useful since most of the farmers work without planning. The information will be delivered and implemented in two ways, one is via a feature phone for each farmer and the other is via a smartphone at a community center or community church. Midori no Heroes will have workshops at those central places where people regularly get together in order to learn how to use the smartphones and the information and how to implement it in their farming.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 2.「Plan B: Shared eco-bags」: Goal # 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F7gVdhprz_djVJN_jTDnUQ.png" alt="『Shared eco-bags』Video prototype"><em>『Shared eco-bags』Video prototype</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: 「Tackling the problem of shoppers consuming an excessive and unnecessary number of plastic bags at grocery stores and convenience stores in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Their idea：In Japan, 305 million plastic bags are used every year (300 bags/year for each person). Plastic bags take more than 1,000 years to decompose. Plan B is a reusable eco-bag that enables people to share / get benefit by using them.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 3. 「DiverCity」：Goal # 4 Quality Education</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Cx2-CIN1pMzQRtbD5TtX3Q.png" alt="『DiverCity』website prototype： https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/"><em>『DiverCity』website prototype： <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/">https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/</a></em></p>\n<p>Challenge: How can we design a solution that promotes respect for diversity and individual differences in Japanese schools?</p>\n<p>Their idea：DiverCity is a network of local people who have important life lessons they want to teach. Choosing a career, going your own way, learning from your mistakes, and finding your true self. <em>Tayoubi</em> means “diversity day” in Japanese. We encourage schools to set a specific day or time to think about diversity issues. They can make use of our “Diversity Bank” of local residents with interesting stories to tell. We also provide a “Diversity Pack” of lesson ideas and discussion topics for teachers introducing diversity education to their classrooms. Teachers and schools are free to decide how they implement Tayoubi, according to their available time and other resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 4. 「Sea You Soon」：Goal # 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lVZc5xZXqvGMC5kn_jFbKg.png" alt="『SEA you soon』Mockup for an app service"><em>『SEA you soon』Mockup for an app service</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: How can we design a solution that turns Tokyo’s water resources into recreational community-building spaces while promoting awareness of the importance of water in our lives?</p>\n<p>Their idea：We provide easy access to coastal journeys with experienced fishermen through an app called “SEA you soon’’. One can experience catching fish and eating and cooking them with the locals. The aim is to give people an attachment to the coastal environment for a more sustainable waterfront development.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 5. 「Smart Mirror Companion」：Goal # 3 Good Health and Well-Being</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*t5uL6jiHebslCy3XgXiCsQ.png" alt="『Smart Mirror Companion』Video prototype"><em>『Smart Mirror Companion』Video prototype</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: Combating the world’s health problems by focusing on well-being and making sure everyone has the tools and resources to be healthy.</p>\n<p>Their idea：A mirror powered by a digital personal assistant (like Siri) to be your partner when you need 1) medical assistance 2) or just a companion to be there for you.</p>\n<p>Aren’t these ideas great and inspiring? I know that these are not PERFECT perfect — because they were done only in 2 days — but it is surely the beginning of something exciting. Marco, the co-founder of Global Goals Jam, told me that it’s all about “Think BIG, start SMALL, act FAST!”, and I think it could not be phrased any better.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10368/1*cEMHeNs2OYedBQ-hwQrffg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>As a person who ALWAYS thinks of things in the context of cities and urbanism, I can’t help but think how valuable it would be to use this structure for the re-development of Tokyo. At the moment, everything seems to be “Think SMALL, start BIG, act SLOW!”. I’d love to apply the design sprint method we’ve learned during the Global Goals Jam to some of the critical urban problems we are facing, such as a shortage of childcare facilities, a lack of safe bicycle infrastructure, an unaffordable housing market, and energy shortages, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>I hope you can also come and join us for this year’s Global Goals Jam 2018 #Tokyo!</p>\n</section>\n'},"4kk+":function(e,t){},"524c":function(e,t,a){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var n=a("tvg5"),o=a("r0YV"),i=a("XyMi"),s=!1;var r=function(e){s||a("/59i")},c=Object(i.a)(n.a,o.a,o.b,!1,r,"data-v-9e5686de",null);c.options.__file="pages/_city/_post.vue",t.default=c.exports},"52BU":function(e,t,a){var n={"./Copenhagen.json":"W1tB","./Madrid.json":"Ssj1","./Manila.json":"qbLw","./amsterdam.json":"Z/EB","./arcosanti.json":"vNdf","./austin.json":"lVi9","./denver.json":"0PK1","./kuala lumpur.json":"K8CU","./locations.json":"Xf+a","./los angeles.json":"V4Qm","./new york.json":"8lQF","./newyork.json":"Fda7","./nowhere.json":"sao2","./portland.json":"c/SV","./posts.json":"GTTH","./sanfrancisco.json":"YRjf","./tokyo.json":"eGme","./vancouver.json":"SYNZ","./vienna.json":"6qk1"};function o(e){return a(i(e))}function i(e){var t=n[e];if(!(t+1))throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'.");return t}o.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},o.resolve=i,e.exports=o,o.id="52BU"},"5lll":function(e,t){e.exports={public:!0,date:"12/12/2017",category:"essay",mapPosition:{location:"100Banch",bearing:0,center:[139.7047394,35.6559546],zoom:12,pitch:0}}},"6Bn+":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",function(){return n}),a.d(t,"b",function(){return o});var n=function(){var e=this.$createElement;this._self._c;return this._m(0)},o=[function(){var e=this.$createElement,t=this._self._c||e;return t("div",{staticClass:"footer"},[t("p",[this._v("\n     All content copyright Mariko Sugita, except where noted."),t("br"),this._v("\n     Static site built using "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://nuxtjs.org/guide",target:"_blank"}},[this._v("Nuxt.js")]),this._v(" and hosted with "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/mariko9012",target:"_blank"}},[this._v("Github Pages")]),this._v(".\n   ")])])}];n._withStripped=!0},"6qk1":function(e,t){e.exports=[{slug:"Introduction",city:"vienna",title:" Urbanism-Related Things to do and read @Vienna",description:" \n\n Things to do, places to go\n\n1.

This decline raises a lot of social issues such as daycare, taxation and a critical labor shortage — and remarkably the increasing number of vacant homes, stores and abandoned infrastructure is part of the problem we are facing.</p>\n<p>In recent years, people have gradually started to realize that not using these vacant buildings in order to create something valuable for their communities is a waste. This is the reason why renovation is becoming increasingly popular as a way of urban intervention. It is an act of appreciating what we already have, and updating it to add new value so that it can fit the needs of our contemporary life and future.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the “renovation school” in Japan?</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F6PbXBfZ7E7dxPww99XMVw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>The Renovation School, originally started in Kyushu in 2011, is a d/4 days “place of practice” into which participants are divided into small units and come up with action plans to reuse the targeted vacant houses. Participants also need to think about business models to make the plans realistic and feasible. At the end, the participants then propose these plans to the real estate owners, aiming to bring these plans to fruition after school. Although it is called “school”, it’s not about the “learning”, but rather the “doing”.</p>\n<p>I heard about this movement when I lived in Copenhagen, and I’d been wanting to be part of it ever since. In 2017, I finally had an opportunity to participate in a 3-day Renovation School, which at this time focused on the Ikegami area, the south part of Tokyo. The school was under the sponsorship of the Tokyu Corporation — one of the major private railway companies and land developers in Japan — which I found it a little ironic, but I’ll talk more about that later in this post.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I try to explain what Renovation School in Japan is like, and how it (even though they never really articulate it as it is) uses a great design sprint method within the 3 days. I hope it also helps you understand a little bit where Japanese urbanism is heading.</p>\n<h2><strong>3 day design sprint to come up with the future of abandoned buildings in Tokyo</strong></h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the School, participants (by the way, even though it’s called “school”, most of us were not students but full time workers) were divided into small teams. Each team got to meet a house owner who owns a vacant building — they don’t know what to do with it. Our mission is to come up with a renovation plan and business model for that vacant building in order to give it a new life. I will quickly summarise what we have done in 3 days at the Renovation School.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*FTdpAiaS5TSc8OZtlSXeAQ.jpeg" alt="Day 1: UNDERSTANDING — Area Analysis &amp; Field work"><em>Day 1: UNDERSTANDING — Area Analysis &amp; Field work</em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Z_y6229J5g_nQ85ST3hyaA.jpeg" alt="This little building was our team’s assignment"><em>This little building was our team’s assignment</em></p>\n<p>The first day is all about input and developing an understanding of the area — these buildings are empty for a reason, right? It’s not like we can make WHATEVER in WHENEVER. No one wants to build a Disneyland in the middle of nowhere. If we don’t create shared knowledge and explore the problem from all angles under a shared brain, it’s extremely difficult to come up with a realistic plan — that’s why this first day of understanding is crucial during the Renovation School, we were told.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*q22-7jUckq3_ZNrTwgB56Q.jpeg" alt="Doing an interview with a local shop owner"><em>Doing an interview with a local shop owner</em></p>\n<p>This time’s focus area is called Ikegami, which is known as the last stop of the Tokyu Ikegami railway Line. The area has attracted many people since ancient times, as it is part of the path to the famous Ikegami Honmonji Temple. However, Ikegami is not an exception to the sad Japanese urban reality, that faces the population decline and the rising rate of vacancy.</p>\n<p>We spend the first day doing field work and intense desktop analysis, observing the people in the area and physical environment, as well as gathering data such as demography and learning about histories. We also conducted a lot of interviews with shop owners around our targeted vacant buildings.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hLA_osE-ydxA9lfR-9e-ag.jpeg" alt="Day 2: SKETCH &amp; DECIDE — Brainstorming &amp; Synthesis / Idea Sketch"><em>Day 2: SKETCH &amp; DECIDE — Brainstorming &amp; Synthesis / Idea Sketch</em></p>\n<p>We gathered the memos of interviews, new findings obtained from field work,documents/materials to explain the history, demographic data etc — time for synthesis. The question to be asked is, of course, what is needed in this place? We had an intense brainstorming session to come up with the solicitations and we chose which ideas should be prototyped.</p>\n<p>Although there were countless ideas to reuse the vacant houses — such as making it a coworking space, cafe, private residence, etc…, it is likely that some of these ideas just don’t quite fit in certain places. We also need to think about the users and stakeholders, management and management systems too!</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*2FbZ5bN0u3ysuySqnY05iw.jpeg" alt="Day 3: PROTOTYPE AND VALIDATE"><em>Day 3: PROTOTYPE AND VALIDATE</em></p>\n<p>Finally we presented our idea in front of the building owners, landowner and developer, and of course, the locals and see how they interact with our ideas and get direct feedback from the target audience. Even though we had a great idea, we knew that the presentation for them is as important as coming up with solution ideas themselves — otherwise, who will give our ideas a chance?</p>\n<p>That was a rough summary of what we did during the 3 days, and below, I will share the three things that I learned from the renovation school.</p>\n<h2>1. Always think about the actual actors — we don’t need “faceless” proposals anymore</h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LlqstS4qGEzywR2mQx1Kfw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>The purpose of the renovation school is to make the ACTION plan, not the proposal itself. That is why the business model and the feasibility of the management system are quite important — otherwise, what’s the point of having a proposal?</p>\n<p>Our team members were full of ideas — renovating an empty building into a community center and inviting more people / would be amazing to have an bar inside so that people could gather and chill.But, then, who can proceed? When the question was returned, silence often spreads fast.</p>\n<p>When the question “who will do it?” remains ambiguous, only ideas are kept scattered, and at the end of all the good ideas just melt into air. It is necessary to thoroughly discuss the proposals that you really want to realize, a proposal that specifies actual actors.</p>\n<p>….but of course, it doesn’t mean that we can’t “dream” about all the nonsense.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. The importance of interdisciplinality</strong></h2>\n<p>Traditionally, specific experts such as urban planning experts, architects, real estate agents and developers have stipulated the way the city is. However, as society became more complicated nowadays, our citizens are responsible for the way the town is. I believe it is through interdisciplinary cooperation that we can unbind ourselves from the framework of specialised fields. I always find it very suggestive that Jane Jacobs is neither an architect nor an academic researcher.</p>\n<p>The second thing I learned at the renovation school was exactly this interdisciplinary collaboration. In my team (there were 9 of us in total), there was a designer, banker (!), architects, researcher, and media expert as well as a public officials, all different genders and ages. Everybody had different background and beliefs, and for that reason, there were some moments of conflicts and disagreement, I wouldn’t say it was easy — but isn’t this “chaos” itself is what we have in cities?</p>\n<h2>3. Tell the “story” of a place</h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-ajaFFE61gXQgzQC4qrGUQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*glF4I-KZbVvqVXdMrfuseA.jpeg" alt="I love these small details of everyday life inTokyo"><em>I love these small details of everyday life inTokyo</em></p>\n<p>In the Renovation School, as mentioned above, each team gets one existing empty house/building to work on a proposal for. I was taught at the school that we need to add “personality” or, let’s say, “story” to the place, instead of calling it a property — which sounds too static and impersonal.</p>\n<p>If there is no concept or a story that people can sympathise with, as a place where there is nothing to be changed anywhere, new values ​​and the like are not born from there. If you want to create a place that you want to carry your feet, you should scoop out features like characters and characters that stand out from that place and languages ​​together with stories that everyone can sympathise.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*X_6eTYhXJiEi2zl30Pgx_A.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>So…after those intense 3 days, I still ask myself — what is my role in making cities more livable and sustainable? What will happen to Japanese cities in the future? Even though the rate of vacant houses are still rising, most of the big developers in Japan, including Tokyu-Corporation (the organizer of the renovation school for this time), keep constructing new fancy buildings for urban redevelopment. I see an irony here. After spending 3 days of very intense design sprint, I couldn’t stop but hope to see more of those collective actions in Japan, especially NOW when urban development is booming before the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020.</p>\n<p>Let’s just hope that these new urban movements, such as the Renovation School, could shift the direction of Japanese urban development a little bit towards a better tommorow.</p>\n</section>\n'},"E/TR":function(e,t){e.exports=function(){return Function.call.apply(Array.prototype.concat,arguments)}},Fda7:function(e,t){e.exports=[]},"GCp+":function(e,t,a){var n=a("I1WX");"string"==typeof n&&(n=[[e.i,n,""]]),n.locals&&(e.exports=n.locals);(0,a("rjj0").default)("0886ecad",n,!1,{sourceMap:!1})},GTTH:function(e,t){e.exports=[{slug:"Introduction",city:"sanfrancisco",title:" Things to do and read for urbanists @San Francisco",description:" \n\n Things to do, places/project to check out\n\n1.

This is a city’s effort to bring new residents into the central part of Austin to this greener, more sustainable neighborhood.</p>\n<h2>Austin as “carbon neutral”  city</h2>\n<p>In recent years, many cities are pledging to become “carbon neutral” by 2050 - Austin, where car ownership and car-dependent lifestyle seem to be still highly valued, is not the exception. According to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/urban-expeditions/austin/austin-green-buildings-fight-urban-sprawl/">this article</a>, Austin adopted a new legislation to make  “all new homes are to be rated net-zero capable, meaning they produce as much electricity as they consume.”</p>\n<p>Mueller is one of the pioneers of this green buildings movement, aiming to invite the residents back to the city core to live in the sustainable, eco-friendly designed neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a downside too - once a low-income industrial neighborhood, the prices and development have increased rapidly in recent years. According to this well-written article, a market study showed a shortage of nearly 50,000 affordable apartments in 2014.</p>\n<p><img src="Meuller01.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="Meuller02.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="Meuller03.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="Meuller04.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09673.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>On racial diversity and ‘a meaningful community’</h2>\n<p>Aside from the gentrification issue, it’s easy to praise this neighborhood - sustainable, well maintained and functioning central city neighborhood. However, Mueller also struggles with other urban problems like the other neighborhoods in the city.  I found <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/02/13/385495327/a-community-takes-on-racial-tensions-once-hidden-under-the-surface">the article</a> that talks about the racial tension of Mueller and I found it more interesting.</p>\n<p>Mueller is created based on the idea of “new urbanism”, in which a meaningful community plays a great rule. However, there have been some issues with African-American residents who don’t feel so welcomed in this neighborhood.</p>\n<p>It is quite interesting to know that Austin is one of the nation’s fastest-growing metropolis but the only fast-growing city in America with a declining black population (University of Texas report). According to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2014/07/18/african-american-austin/">this report</a>, Austin’s general population jumped 20 percent from 2000 to 2010, but the number of African-Americans shrank by 5 percent.</p>\n<p>Racial tension and everyday racism are of course not limited in Mueller, but while walking around this beautiful neighborhood, I couldn’t stop but thinking what ‘a meaningful community’ is about and how we can create one in our cities in diversity.</p>\n<p><img src="DSC09674.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09676.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09682.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09685.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09689.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="DSC09692.jpg" alt=""></p>\n</section>\n'},I1WX:function(e,t,a){(e.exports=a("FZ+f")(!1)).push([e.i,"",""])},JUUX:function(e,t,a){var n={"./static/posts/arcosanti/arcosanti/ja.md":"+fnL"};function o(e){return a(i(e))}function i(e){var t=n[e];if(!(t+1))throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'.");return t}o.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},o.resolve=i,e.exports=o,o.id="JUUX"},K3OA:function(e,t){e.exports={public:!0,date:"2/16/2018",category:"place",mapPosition:[{location:"Fab Space",bearing:0,center:[101.711938,3.146229],zoom:12,pitch:0},{location:"APW Bangstar",bearing:0,center:[101.67408690000002,3.1243255],zoom:12,pitch:0}]}},K8CU:function(e,t){e.exports=[{slug:"alternativespot",city:"kuala lumpur",title:" 2 alternative spots to visit in Kuala Lumpur",description:" \n\nFew months ago I found this interesting website ALTERNATIVE ASIA, which introduces the interesting independent art spaces in the south east Asian countries.

After a few minutes, a mysterious building complex emerged in front of our eyes.</p>\n<p>48 years after the Soleri’s first construction in 1970, this 25 acres-wide land has developed as an independent ‘town’ with a community of architects and urban designers who are influenced by Soleri’s legacy - there are still around 80 people living in Arcosanti, actively engaging in the realization of the plan.</p>\n<p><img src="arcosanti02.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="arcosanti03.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="arcosanti04.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>The goal of Arcosanti is to explore the concept of ‘arcology’ - which combines architecture and ecology - as a way to pursue the improvement of urban conditions while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth.</p>\n<p>Soleri, got tired and sick of American car culture and urban sprawl (which I wholeheartedly understand), proposed to provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilitieies within in the vicinity so that people can enjoy walkable urban environment while minimizing individual human environmental impact and economically self-sufficient.</p>\n<p><img src="arcosanti05.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="arcosanti06.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="arcosanti07.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Living urban laboratory - still a long way to go</h2>\n<p>During the tour within Arcosanti, we are informed that this desert “utopia” still attracts many curious architects, designers and artists from all over the world - even after Soleri’s alleged sexual abuse on his own daughter and the whole plan had suspended. The community currently represents over 10 nationalities. The requirement for residency includes participation on a serious of workshops and active engagement of the community. It was quite interesting to see how people live and engage with their neighbors - some of them got jobs inside of Arcosanti and some of them work outside/online.

It was my first journey to Thailand and I didn’t have any prior knowledge about the city. For the first few days we visited the major famous temples and markets etc., all the touristic spots for which you can easily find information on Google or in guidebooks. However, I knew that something was missing.</p>\n<p>I appreciate local culture and the daily life that is lived and constantly being updated by the people who live there. For me. it is far more meaningful to visit a local community center than to over-spend in an expensive restaurant in a touristic city center.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google Maps couldn’t give me what I wanted, even with intensive research. What changed my stay in Bangkok was this beautiful map, which I found by change at a local creative space called<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/the-jam-factory-bangkok.htm"> the Jam Factory Bangkok</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3-F6ftwV93Il-X92VEL3pw.jpeg" alt="Image by Nancy Chandler’s Thailand"><em>Image by <a href="http://nancychandler.net/nancychandlersblog.html">Nancy Chandler’s Thailand</a></em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2812/1*RQO6j2U2r-_RKhTKMS9IHw.jpeg" alt="Image by Nancy Chandler’s Thailand"><em>Image by <a href="http://nancychandler.net/nancychandlersblog.html">Nancy Chandler’s Thailand</a></em></p>\n<p>What’s so special about this map, with its excellent hand-drawing, is that it appears very… let’s say “biased” in a good way. Sure, there are some objective facts written on it, such as the names of the temples and so on, but you can really feel the presence of a map maker who has walked through and “felt” specific parts of the city in their own way. It talks about all the seemingly “useless” small things that you never read on Google Maps.</p>\n<p>It even reminds me of<a href="https://use-it.travel/home"> USE-It Map Europe</a>, which is an alternative map making movement for young travelers that I can never stop loving.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0pebAn2aV90Qgx02TNKdAw.png" alt="USE-it Map Europe: https://use-it.travel/home"><em>USE-it Map Europe: <a href="https://use-it.travel/home">https://use-it.travel/home</a></em></p>\n<h2>No map is neutral</h2>\n<p>Maps tell stories.</p>\n<p>We see maps on a daily bases: On our phones, in the stations, in guidebooks etc… to get from point A to B.

On the other hand, something like Nancy Chandler’s map of Bangkok, which contains personal opinions, feelings, and memories, might be judged as “illogical”.</p>\n<p>But is it really so black and white?</p>\n<p>In fact, we can’t trust these “logical maps” as a pure “fact” either.</p>\n<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhLrEAgeMs4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<p>This brilliant talk by Monica Stephens teaches us to be more critical about what digital maps (and analogue maps, even though they aren’t mentioned in the talk) are showing us. I won’t summarize her argument here in detail, but her message is clear — our maps are different based on our world view. And we should wonder whose world view and whose perception we are seeing on the maps, and whose perspective has been left out.</p>\n<p>For instance, the Mercator projection has famously been criticized for spreading a western-oriented world view, and there is an extreme inequality of the distribution of spatial information/data that covers the Earth’ surface.</p>\n<p>This is why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vow11HYG7HQ">Henk van Houtum</a> in his TED talk powerfully calls for the need to make new maps, to free the map from politics and emancipate it from the dominant world view — and make it our own.</p>\n<h2>Subjective Map Workshop</h2>\n<p>What if we each had our OWN map, one that didn’t get filtered by Google Maps and someone else’s world view? What if we had maps that talked about the small, local details that are otherwise left out by mainstream map making?</p>\n<p>With this motivation, some of my colleagues and I decided to throw a subjective map workshop in different parts of Tokyo — and we chose Shibuya as the first location.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*Y5VEWsyb4jqUD-L-nSpexg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*j-2SLsrfImpoOnShuKhmkA.png" alt="The idea was to collect multiple ideas and combine them together, and to make it sharable with others!"><em>The idea was to collect multiple ideas and combine them together, and to make it sharable with others!</em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*_-DTBn1Rn-Yz0gMlfSaHIg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>At the beginning, we learned map making techniques and the storytelling power of maps. Afterwards we just simply went out onto the streets for individual fieldwork, and wrote down our personal stories or opinions through own perspectives. For those who didn’t know what to do, I advised them to pay attention to personal memories and any attachments to a specific part of the city as well as sense of belonging, tips to enjoy favorite spots, even smell, sense of security, light and darkness, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*KsTcVBNtuqS1-1lLIGXjMQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*oJumCUy_D-wUo3VUr6X64g.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*UjejxhR8H7GlttxJ5Hjggw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*aHOJjlyLmGAcIGlTtX3JIA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3936/1*KmPmDAS_Gv6CNZ7sDYdrzA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*ql9zdw-89dY9Ryj1d_Xg0w.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*qxQCHCVW_bdPtEAUeYROLQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*Z_WiLJ8K6tBT4vIYhJ1uhg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*RlymD5GP9noaz_Wm5gruTA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*Gy5b52e0pxKukD_Y-ASMBQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*5G7fWTZmHYj_LbljUSE0cg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*ocdUV80pTplvLur7N0Mq0Q.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3936/1*TfiujDfr6H36n5q321e_QA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>This is the result.

This is an attempt to give a long-term effect ( XL) in a short-term small practice (XS).</p>\n<p>The project has been doing various activities since 2013,from<a href="http://shibuyahack.com/2017/07/streetfurnitureinchuogai/"> making street furniture</a> to<a href="http://shibuyahack.com/2018/02/ese_shibuya_exhibition/"> organising an art exhibition</a> ; however, there has been a clear distance between it and the mainstream urban regeneration that is happening in Shibuya.</p>\n<p>Thus, we wanted to tackle the question of how we can connect the small-scaled bottom-up citizen initiatives with large-scale urban developments, which tend to leave the grassroots initiatives behind. It also involves the question of how we can make sense of the distance between our everyday lives and actions and the meta-scaled narrative and representation of Tokyo.</p>\n<p>This post briefly covers the discussion we had that day.</p>\n<p>※<em>This post is based on:<a href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Floftwork.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2F20180313_hmc_report&amp;h=ATMB4AWkQqiqV6gUJLAJMpUWFMIkYB1JcKAdPhFCdrdxKIaCj31JlPZ4DgYwSoJSOTv8jeAnNRo3MM2KX-oG1Ij5SHuC9c6jVmXL_Pe8f7gxj6HjMcFW_w3hLh8"> https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*IEAJ4RS-SlSJcmKu.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Floftwork.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2F20180313_hmc_report&amp;h=ATMB4AWkQqiqV6gUJLAJMpUWFMIkYB1JcKAdPhFCdrdxKIaCj31JlPZ4DgYwSoJSOTv8jeAnNRo3MM2KX-oG1Ij5SHuC9c6jVmXL_Pe8f7gxj6HjMcFW_w3hLh8">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2><strong>What if there is the opposite to “broken window theory?”</strong></h2>\n<p>I know that “connecting various urban practices across scales” sounds a bit ambitious , so let me break it down a little bit more to show you what we had in mind.</p>\n<p>We started from the image of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">*Powers of Ten</a>*” , a film by Charles and Ray Eames. It illustrates the world — from everyday picnics to cosmic mystery and even to the level of a carbon atom — as an arena of continuity. It is a work that travels from the viewpoint of XL to that of XS, and has exponential powers to emphasize the importance of scale.</p>\n<p>Another example; the broken windows theory was proposed by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982. Iit is the theory that uses broken windows as a metaphor/indicator showing disorder and the decay of neighborhoods. If there is one broken window in the town, this will lead to another being broken and another, which ultimately leads to arise in the crime rate of the town as a whole, and finally linking to urban disorder and incivility within a community.</p>\n<p>The broken window theory is a negative example, but it certainly highlights the importance of scales — the world as an arena of continuity. What if we can design the opposite phenomenon to the broken window theory by connecting various urban practices to achieve abigger effect?</p>\n<p>Below are some of the quotes from the guest speakers on this topic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Citizens who use and update their cities — Yukako Ishikawa</strong></h2>\n<p>Yukako Ishikawa, a director of Shibuya Hack Project, said that the “broken window theory” has a lot in common with tactical urbanism , which is the approach that this project is taking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Our motivation is to encourage the XS size bottom-up approach by citizens, who are often disconnected by large scale urban development by the administration or private companies. We need a common language to find a familiar arena between the two different scales.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6nGHIonXubV8o5Oi.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<h2><strong>Citizens’ everyday lives (XS) in the urban community — Jun Aoki (Nest.inc)</strong></h2>\n<p>Mr. Aoki, a famous landlord in Japan, believes that the smallest unit of our urban space is the residents’ everyday lives and their living space. In Aoki’s rental housings, the residents can make home gardens and organize events by themselves or create shared offices and customize their homes as they want — something that is quite rare in Japan.</p>\n<p>He has also devoted himself to revitalizing<a href="https://goo.gl/T6PdXf"> Minami-Ikebukuro Park</a>, which was re-opened in spring 2016 after five years of renovations. This park is now a popular hangout and lunch spot for locals with various activities such as Marche, film screenings, and weddings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The place of living should be connected to a community and its surroundings — we can scale up from XS to S by letting people have freedom to use their living space and sort of encroach towards their urban surroundings.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bVxnUYJ7s7fs4eIo.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2><strong>“Urban management” as a way to connect the various urban scales — Atsumi Hayashi (Tokyo R Real Estate)</strong></h2>\n<p>Mr. Hayashi, co-chairman of<a href="https://www.realtokyoestate.co.jp/"> Tokyo R Real Estate</a> and the architecture firm<a href="http://www.speac.co.jp/"> SPEAC</a> argues the importance of applying the concept of management into cities as a way to include the industrial strategies and human resources and other manageable factors to establish a creative place in microscopic thinking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It is important to have strategies and management skills to concern the large-scaled regional socio-economic sustainability while putting people first and believing in the power of smallness led by the citizens.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*MQwXhTbCz6Q-fI4y.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2>Workshop</h2>\n<p>The event also involved fieldwork to the riverside in Shibuya and a subsequent workshop.

During the firs week of my masters, one of my Danish classmates said to me, “There is an interesting boat in Copenhagen, come and have a look.”</p>\n<p>I still remember that day very well. It was very foggy evening. After a party we decided to go have a look at boat on the harbor and I was amazed by the size of the boat.</p>\n<p>When I got told a boat I imagined something small, but when I saw I didn’t expect the boat to be so big. It was surrounded by electronic devices, robots and other junk, I feel in love with that mysterious feel straight away.</p>\n<p><em><strong>It’s like one scene out of a movie! What sort of boat was it?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> ILLUTRON was once called* a half-machine* and was used to dig cables and wiring when building bridges around Denmark. After fulfilling his role, a friend of us bought the boat that had been neglected for a long time at the port in the Christiania district of Copenhagen. The encounter with the boat that night was the start up and operation of ILLUTRON.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dzl, you are also one of the core members of ILLUTRON, and also FabLab in Roskilde city. Could you tell me about your background?</strong></em></p>\n<p><img src="illutron03.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> I am from Copenhagen and I have always been involved with technology and art. I have created art work myself, taught various skills in the technology.</p>\n<p>FabLab, which I am part of, is located on the campus of Roskilde University and puts emphasis on education. Since it is an open space, it isn’t just for students but also for the general public. We teach them how to use various machines such as 3D printers and laser cutters and also run tutorials according to their needs regarding technology in general.</p>\n<p>In many Fab Spaces, they are told “You can use 3D printers and laser cutters freely, good luck!,” and they are left to figure it out on their own. But, in FabLab, the staff looks at the materials together and gives advice for their projects so that amateurs can use and understand it easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> In Copenhagen, there is currently a big movement in terms of technology and art, therefore we put a huge emphasis the educating part.</p>\n<h2>ILLUTRON was born from the desire to create “our own place.”</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Why did you decide to reconstruct it into a maker space, not anything else?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> In Denmark, there were several small maker space, mainly in the Christiania district and Vestabro district, and it was the experiment site of various projects. These spaces were scattered in low-priced areas such as closed down industrial areas.</p>\n<p>However, in recent years, it was swallowed by the swell of re-development. With the population of Copenhagen increasing dramatically, building offices and apartments were built in in areas that didn’t have many developments.</p>\n<p>The artists and creators who gathered ins mall maker space areas had been driven away. It is those who had created new places and have made the area interesting, but they were kicked out as soon as the area became required for re-development. Due to this, artists and creators felt that they needed a their, ‘own place,’ which could never be driven out.</p>\n<p><img src="illutron04.jpg" alt=""><br>\n<em>One of the performances at ILLUTRON.See: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/illutron/">ILLUTRON facebook</a></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>It is related to the issue of gentrification in Copenhagen.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> Yes indeed. That is why it was important that “ILLUTRON can never be kicked out no matter what happens”. For example, the Vestablo district, which was originally a very low rent area, has become a popular spot in recent years for tourists and investors which means artists living there originally have been forced out.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong>  ILLUTRON floats in the water and can move anywhere so nothing can be kicked out!</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong>  That’s why the representatives of the maker space cooperated and gathered funds and bought a ship together. Because it is a used ship, we repaired it together. There are still a few places that have not been repaired yet …. But this boat is ours so no one can take over!</p>\n<h2>Involving locals while moving</h2>\n<p><img src="illutron05.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> After the repairs of the ship and the official opening of ILLUTRON we have set up various projects such as large scale crafts which many could participate in and a number of small projects.</p>\n<p>Is there anything you are particular about while doing these projects?</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> ILLUTRON is constantly moving from port to port of Copenhagen and we are trying to connect with the community in that area when we do the project. I think a good example is when it was anchored in Sydhavnen.</p>\n<p>This area used to be an industrial area, but recently the influx of wealthy families means many new apartments are being built. It was interesting that the residents here were initially distant from us. I think the thought it was a gathering of weird people. Various experiments and work were done in ILLUTRON, and sometimes blow a fire from a ship as part of the performance (laughs), I guess that would make people wary!</p>\n<p>We started to think it was hopeless and then we decided to do engineering workshops for kids in the area. By involving kids we were able to get more people involved and families in the area to join the workshops, art events and performances.</p>\n<p>It was very pleasant to see the “odd-ballers” who ride around second-hand ships and the wealthy families in this area working on the same project. Currently, instead of Sydhavnen we are anchored at the other ports of Copenhagen, but the way we involve locals has not changed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What does it mean to involve the locals of the area?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> ILLUTRON is a public space. No matter where it is anchored anyone can come in freely and do whatever they want to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> We do various activities such as large-scale cultural events named “KulturHavn” (cultural port) and anyone can participate easily. We don’t just do performances, we also hang screens up to show movies and experiments showing robots.</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> In particular, “access to waterside” is one of the most important topics. The port of Copenhagen is operated by private companies there are actually very few places where people can enjoy the waterside. That is why ILLUTRON often does projects with waterfront as a theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> There are definitely many projects that use boats or something floating on water. Having a small orchestra on a small boat and go along the port, and in Christmas we do a floating tree.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How do you get the staffs and expenses?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> We have 20 main members, but we constantly have new members who bring new ideas to the table. Now the original members are completely hands off and it has be handed down to the younger generations. It has become an autonomous ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Usually it is necessary to pay to have your boat on the port but as long as we are doing cultural events we have been told by the Copenhangen city council that we can have out boat on the port for free. We also manage by getting funding for each project and the membership free from the members.</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> ILLUTRON is a physical space as well as an area for networking It is used by various organizations and individuals who have a range of ideas and skills and it has also become a very active community on SNS.</p>\n<h2>If you think of something, give it ago- ‘Do-ocracy’</h2>\n<p><em><strong>I’d love to hear your key tips for running a community!</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> For myself I am more of a provider of facility than a creator. For example, ‘Idemo Lab,’ is something we are currently setting up, and by organizing up workshops and events in this space, we create communities and you’re able to support the growth of a range of different people - this is the mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> That’s right. At events we are setting, it is important that it is not just interactivity but it is also participatory. There is no point to expect that people will just have fun automatically. What we cherish is the participation of the people from the ideas they have brought in and from there news ideas being born.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> The mindset of lets give it shot! Is really important. For example, if you think you want to paint the boat pink, rather than discussing whether I should paint it pink you should just paint it pink! I feel there are a lot of people who just say their opinion but don’t really take that into action. So as long as there isn’t anyone strongly against what you want to do, you should take action and whoever paints the boat pink becomes a winner. Actually doing it is the determining factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> That is ‘Do-ocracy’!</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> Do-ocracy is a Copenhagen mentality — people tend to just do thing without really asking. In this city, new attempts and interesting events are always being done. This is done because people don’t waste time discussing. Because people are like in Copenhagen this there’re lots of interesting pop up events and initiatives all the time.</p>\n<p>So people in Copenhagen not only say their opinions but they also take action. In Japan, there are people complaining about the way people treat the parks but there are very few people that actually take action and do something about it. This is where we should really look up to in terms of people in Copenhagen.</p>\n<h2>“Meaningful” experience is important</h2>\n<p><img src="illutron06.jpg" alt=""><em>One day at Fablab. Reference: <a href="https://typo3.ruc.dk/Uddannelse/Bacheloruddannelser/Humanistisk-Teknologisk-Bacheloruddannelse/FabLab-RUC">FabLab Official HP</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> We are also conscious about being, ‘meaningful.’ Since ILLUTRON is a maker space, it deals with technology a lot of the time, but in recent years it tends to be“technology for technology” — this means a type of technology being made where personal experiences are being ignored. This is something we are very conscious about.</p>\n<p>I am studying the concept of “Meaningful Smart Product” with IdemoLab of DELTA. For example, you’re wearing a very nice watch today, you must have a lot of feelings towards and memories with that watch. Image that you have 5 more similar smart watches which may be useful. What if you don’t have the same feelings towards those watches? No matter how far technology goes, if something isn’t meaningful between the person and the object, could you say that it is something really good for us?</p>\n<p><em><strong>This is a very interesting issue. You can say something similar with the experiences in the city.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> Personal attachment is important. There are many forward thinking cities that function without any problems, but cities become something special only when there are individual experiences, thoughts and memories that are attached to the city.</p>\n<p><img src="illutron07.jpg" alt=""><em>An example of “Meaningful” experiene. In their wedding, Mr. Vanessa wore a bouquet with LED lights and a ring with a galvanic skin reaction device. It is a mechanism that allows Vanessa ‘s mood to be sensed by using the current using the current, blue when she feels calm, and when she is unsure the white in the bouquet changes. In this way, we value how to use technology that closely relates to our own experience and feelings. Reference: <a href="http://www.geekphysical.com/coldfeet_readmore.php">http://www.geekphysical.com/coldfeet_readmore.php</a></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>From this interview, I really think the people in Copenhagen must have a “meaningful” relationship with their city. I wonder if it is possible to do something similar with all the cities around the world.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> It is the people who make the city. If the people in the city want to do it, I think it can happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> No matter how many workshops or events you do, like I mentioned earlier, nothing will happen if you just stand there waiting. This is something we have also experienced, where people come and say, ‘just tell us simply what you’re doing,’ or ‘tell me how to become creative.’ But if there are just people sitting there waiting for something to happen, life won’t be brought to the city.</p>\n<p>No matter how much creative opportunities and space you provide, nothing will happen unless there is awareness or responsibility from the people involved. In other words, having a spirit of your own and having the spirit of Do-ocracy is important. I think this can be said not only just for Copenhagen but for cities in Japan like Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Great point. Please tell me what are your ambition for the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Dzl:</strong> I would like to continue to focus on teaching about technology and manufacturing. I am really inspired by the educational system for creators and artists at MIT’s Fab Academy.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanessa:</strong> I want to get away from replying to emails and meetings and try ‘skunk work’. I would like to really focus on a project for about 3 months and from that I think I would be able to see what’s truly important and a vision for the future. I will also continue the research on the “Meaningful Smart Product”</p>\n<p><em><strong>We are looking forward to what the future hold for you! Thank you so much for today!</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>(※This article was originally posted on <a href="http://layout.net">layout.net</a>.

It shows a simulation of segregation that is playfully designed to make it easier for readers to understand. This website is based off the work of Nobel Prize-winning game theorist Thomas Schelling and his 1971 paper on dynamic models of segregation.</p>\n<p>By letting you play with their simulation and explaining the theory step by step along with it, it walks you through how a small demand for diversity can desegregate a neighborhood. I realized how much it helps me to understand the rhetoric if I get to be ‘involved’ and actively being part of a process.</p>\n<p>This leads me to the beauty of playability in the field of games, especially video games. The authors of the website were inspired by Ian Bogost’s book <a href="http://bogost.com/books/persuasive_games/">Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames</a> and I, inspired, decided to read it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why video games are not as bad as we think</strong></h2>\n<p>This book is an analysis of how video games can influence players, even their fundamental attitudes and beliefs about the world.</p>\n<p>Of course, video games have suffered from a negative social connotation and are often not taken seriously.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite their commercial success, video games still struggle for acceptance as a cultural form. They are perceived to serve no cultural or social function save distraction at best, moral baseness at worst. (Bogost, 2010, p15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, according to this book, video games can be a great storytelling medium that have significant impact on players (if they’re used well, of course).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m saying that this is a mature storytelling medium that has enormous power to shape the debates within our culture. (…) this book suggests that video games open a new domain for persuasion, thanks to their core representational mode, procedurally.(…) I call this new form procedural rhetoric, the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures. (Bogost, 2010, p21)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that in mind, I started digging into the games that have a close relationship with the fields of urban design and architecture. Some of them are amazing tools for urban simulation or education, and even for citizen participation.</p>\n<p>Here are three video games I have been playing and loving so far.</p>\n<h2>Video games that are great for city lovers</h2>\n<h3>1. Block’hood</h3>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*eFwmbDY3I9wIF63Z.jpg" alt="Photo from the official website: https://www.plethora-project.com/blockhood/"><em>Photo from the official website: <a href="https://www.plethora-project.com/blockhood/">https://www.plethora-project.com/blockhood/</a></em></p>\n<p>I only started to play <a href="https://www.plethora-project.com/blockhood/">Block’hood</a> recently but this city building simulator video game hasn’t let me down so far. You get to build a city vertically and experience the unique ecosystems within. If you play in story mode, it walks you through the basic principles of urban design (such as connectivity, energy sufficiency, necessary resources and so on) and I think it’s quite helpful for educational purposes.</p>\n<h3>2. Cities: Skylines</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines/CSCS00GSK-MASTER.html">Cities: Skylines</a> is my absolute favorite. I love this TED talk shown below as much as I do the game itself. It is a quite advanced and realistic game and I’m quite sure that you’ll need to use your urban planning knowledge to succeed.</p>\n<iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/karoliina_korppoo_how_a_video_game_might_help_us_build_better_cities" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>It’s also quite fun to look at all the imaginary cities created by other players, and get to know how/why they built it and how it works in the game.</p>\n<p><img src="game01.jpg" alt=""><em>Photo from Steam</em><br>\n<img src="game02.jpg" alt=""><em>Photo from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xj4ciP0Riw">Cities:Skylines Review</a></em></p>\n<h3>3. Block by Block (Minecraft)</h3>\n<p>Minecraft is an older, famous video game, but what I want to highlight is not Minecraft itself but the initiative called <a href="https://blockbyblock.org/">Block by Block</a>. Block by Block uses Minecraft to engage with challenged communities through a range of workshops, and raises funds for implementation of public spaces.</p>\n<p>I mean, it’s a super easy and fun game and you can create anything by hand — it’s a brilliant idea to use Minecraft to encourage citizen participation, and to raise awareness that everyone, including non-professionals, can and <em>should</em> engage in our cities and public spaces.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0tpzhR-cNmhy-bau.jpg" alt="Photo from the official website: Block by Block"><em>Photo from the official website: <a href="https://blockbyblock.org/">Block by Block</a></em></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and please contact me if you have any recommendations!</p>\n</section>\n'},oiqV:function(e,t){e.exports={public:!0,date:"11/24/2016",category:"essay",mapPosition:{bearing:0,center:[139.7047394,35.6559546],zoom:12,pitch:0}}},"ozE+":function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h1>Austin Creative Reuse</h1>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnr5nmwKq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>I found this little place called <a href="https://austincreativereuse.org/">Austin Creative Reuse</a>, which is run by a nonprofit organization that collects, sells, and distributes donated articles.
