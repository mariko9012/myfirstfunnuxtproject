The term “urbanist” is not popularly used in the Japanese context, but I believe that what Japanese cities (particularly Tokyo) need in this age of rapid transformation is to go beyond “civil engineering” and the idea that the urban environment is the playground of merely architects and planners.</p>\n<h2>Urbanist MeetUp Tokyo</h2>\n<p>Cities are formed/imagined/lived and used by people from various backgrounds and with interests. The increasingly popular Japanese concept of “machi-zukuri” (community/neighborhood planning — check out this article<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0955580022000008745"> here</a>), for instance, means a departure from the traditional form of top-down planning and covers variety of fields, such as community development, renovation, regional branding, town development, real estate, geography, architecture, and more. Yes, there are tons of professions that are closely related to cities, not only architects and planners — so what is the meaning of connecting all these activities and professions on the horizontal axis?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KhR9gu4HI_5x8PeRTYHBdw.jpeg" alt=""><br>\n<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZAcYtkmVfFvpKeTMaOXRag.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>2017 December in Tokyo; approximately 150 urbanists showed up to the meetup. The meetup was originally initiated by a few young architects from the renovation industry, who have been gathering and holding a party every year for the past 4 years in order to extend the narrow frame of the industry.</p>\n<p>Since then, the concept has spread not only among the renovation industry but also to real estate, architectural design, town planning and other areas. This time, we expanded the frame further and gathered a wide variety of people who were related to cities in various ways in order to create a more inviting and strong community — we decided to name it “Urbanist MeetUp”.</p>\n<p>In this meetup, the word “urbanist” was widely defined as “people who make/use/live cities”, and we invited 23 urbanists to give a short pitch about their activities — their approach and passion for cities. A small game followed to elicit conversation among participants.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this meetup was that there was a variety of professions involved — not only architects and planners, but also people from community development, writers and editors from the media covering a variety of urban issues, and IT engineers who are developing apps about cities. All the speakers and participants were able to meet others who are equally passionate about cities, but had totally different professions and approaches. If that doesn’t trigger a conversation towards brand-new ideas and inspiration, what will?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*gcwsC6txM0SI0n27IsbWzQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*k8vmwM3oLRZ6Y5fy9l4pZQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Fireside Chat for cities@Tokyo</h2>\n<p>As another example , a few months ago my colleague and I organized a meetup called “Fireside Chat for Cities” . This was a meetup for urbanists to discuss various topics related to cities in an interactive manner. We gathered in a small bar on Shinjuku Golden Street, and the focus was a discussion of the subjective, personal stories of the participants.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*is3alF3-N-K-Vh7VAj2JJw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3998/1*XGsFsQo0HPG6aGr-53t0gQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>We came up with some random city-related themes such as “noise, crowded trains, staircases, drinking companions, convenience stores, windows, romance, smell, gender” , whereby each participant selected one of the themes and talked about what they had experienced regarding that topic in cities. The aim was to grasp our cities through the complexity of how one experiences and lives in a city and gets to know the others’ different approaches and opinions.</p>\n<p>Most of the participants were not architects or urban planners, but when they talked about their subjective memories and experiences of the cities, it really didn’t matter who “knew” the city better.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*CtGxKf36qMHkK5R5K4bmGA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3000/1*tdUbhqoxzQYirPzDuht5fg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>Who is the “urbanist”?</h2>\n<p>In Japan, the word urbanism is often translated in association with urban planning and civil engineering skills, and in many cases it is considered that urbanist = urban planner. However, if the urbanist is grasped broadly as those people who “make” cities and “use/live” cities, we can bring together people from a wide variety of specialized fields, like those gathered in this meetup under the same term — even the citizens.</p>\n<p>The term urbanist is also becoming more and more acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Scott Bonjukian, a writer in<a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/01/19/why-i-call-myself-an-urbanist/"> The Urbanist,</a> published an article in 2016 called “<a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2016/01/19/why-i-call-myself-an-urbanist/">Why I call myself an urbanist</a>” in which he said that the English words “urbanism” and “urbanist” have recently become popular. He summaries that “<em>urbanists want more people (of all types) to have equal access to housing variety (apartments, townhouse, backyard cottages, houses, duplexes, etc.), more ways to get around (transit, walking, bicycling, ride-share, vanpool, etc.), more to see and do (parks, cafes, bars, museums, shops, etc.), and to have more grassroots influence on city government.</em>” He defines himself as one of them.</p>\n<p>In response to this article, Brandon Donnelly, an architectural blogger and creator, said: *“If you look it up in the dictionary, you’ll likely get something along the lines of: someone who is a specialist in city planning. But I bet that there are many people out there who would self-identity as being an urbanist, but who would also not consider themselves specialists in the field. The term has evolved to imply other things.“ *(Brandon Donnelly,<a href="http://brandondonnelly.com/post/137648883663/what-is-an-urbanist"> What is an urbanist?</a>)</p>\n<p>In addition, Christian Dimmer, who teaches urban studies at Waseda University in Tokyo, uses the word “citizen urbanists”, arguing that we citizens as the urban dwellers are the essence of the urbanist.</p>\n<h2>Urbanist in Tokyo</h2>\n<p>To sum up, I believe that those we call urbanists should not only be the “specialists” who make the physical environment of cities (like architects and city planners) but also other specialists and, most importantly, the citizens , who are participating in the urbanity.</p>\n<p>Japan is a country undergoing profound socio-economic and demographic transformation. Tokyo, specifically, is experiencing massive transformation with the very clear goal of hosting the Olympic Games in 2020. Looking at a map of prospective urban development of the whole city, you would be surprised at how many constructions are going on and how <em>similar</em> all these buildings are — all are concrete skyscrapers for fancy offices and hotels.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*18hAqZo_zfRi_y6OPOZrjw.png" alt=""></p>\n<p>While some are taking advantage of this economic boom, there have also been some very concerned voices about citizens’ rights to cities and urban commons. Some say that Tokyo is increasingly changing without the citizens’ will — its changes are based on developers’ money games.</p>\n<p>(If you want to know more about what’s happening, you can check out such research papers as “<a href="https://www.nri.com/~/media/PDF/global/opinion/papers/2015/np2015200.pdf">The need for rebuilding Tokyo with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as impetus</a>”.)</p>\n<p>I want to see more encouraging stories of people who participate and act in Japanese cities, not just of those who are imagined to be the stakeholders and responsible for making them.</p>\n</section>\n'},"43NH":function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h1>Design sprints for sustainable development goals: a recap from Global Goals Jam 2017 #Tokyo</h1>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*K1mn1ASdXth8VQYs1zMJ_w.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>On 16th-17th September 2017, I had the honor of hosting the first edition of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/globalgoalsjam">#GlobalGoalsJam</a> in Tokyo at 100BANCH. Global Goals Jam #Tokyo was a two-day event with short design sprints, using the methods from <a href="http://medialabamsterdam.com/">MediaLAB Amsterdam</a> — we invited various professionals, designers, creators, and students from more than 10 countries to share and develop our ideas.</p>\n<p>During the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2015/9/16/Around-the-world-the-Social-Good-Summit-celebrates-the-Global-Goals-.html">2015 Social Good Summit</a>, 193 world leaders committed to achieving <a href="http://www.globalgoals.org/">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> by the year 2030. As an initiative of the United Nations Development Program and MediaLAB Amsterdam, the Global Goals Jam began to design realistic, actionable interventions for these goals.

This article invites you to get a glimpse at the first edition of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/globalgoalsjam">Global Goals Jam</a> #Tokyo.</p>\n<h2><strong>It’s actually very rare in Tokyo to have an event entirely in English, with people from various backgrounds.</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*_VGXsJBMAxLeDXTPksZrnw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>One thing I wanted to make happen was to make the event truly international and diverse. That means: it should welcome anyone regardless of their age, nationality, gender…. And it should be held in English.</p>\n<p>Tokyo is a big, global metropolis and — well, if you know OTHER big metropolises like New York and London, you might be surprised to know that the proportion of foreigners in Tokyo is surprisingly low. Thus, everyday contact with people from different cultural backgrounds is still a rare experience for most Japanese, especially for those who don’t feel comfortable speaking in English. In Global Goals Jam #Tokyo, I was pleased to see people from Japan, Canada, the USA, Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mauritius, etc. One of the participants from Mauritius told me that she has been looking for this kind of event in Tokyo for a long time.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter how well you speak English. What matters is working with someone from a different cultural background and exchanging opinions in a common language towards the same goal. Believe me, I know it can sometimes be very awkward and frustrating. But it’s worth it.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*OIjCrTzgzwT96UH01dmVHw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*2omWP-koPhB6NM2rT6deVA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*YhsufNauOkWwEpO1gnHoKg.jpeg" alt="David Willoughby from Workers University joined the event as one of the facilitators"><em>David Willoughby from <a href="http://www.workers-u.com/">Workers University</a> joined the event as one of the facilitators</em></p>\n<h2><strong>We learned the Design Sprints method from Amsterdam Media Lab.</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9794/1*tTl02fXIjQuZD0e5-7OrwQ.jpeg" alt="**Sprint #1 Organize it, experience it / Sprint #2 Respond to it**This was about identifying problems and organizing our ideas">***Sprint #1 Organize it, experience it / Sprint #2 Respond to it<br>\n*<em>This was about identifying problems and organizing our ideas</em></p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered what the heck a “design methodology” is?

While leaving out the very fine details that actually fit into the local contexts, Amsterdam Media Lab provides a common language of design methods for the design field (they call it a mission to fight “design waste”), which is open and accessible and where even the beginners can dive straight in.</p>\n<p>Check out this <a href="https://medialabamsterdam.com/toolkit/">toolkit</a> — it has all the tools we can use, explaining each step that needs to be followed.

The team assumes that basic information such as weather forecasting can be useful since most of the farmers work without planning. The information will be delivered and implemented in two ways, one is via a feature phone for each farmer and the other is via a smartphone at a community center or community church. Midori no Heroes will have workshops at those central places where people regularly get together in order to learn how to use the smartphones and the information and how to implement it in their farming.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 2.「Plan B: Shared eco-bags」: Goal # 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F7gVdhprz_djVJN_jTDnUQ.png" alt="『Shared eco-bags』Video prototype"><em>『Shared eco-bags』Video prototype</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: 「Tackling the problem of shoppers consuming an excessive and unnecessary number of plastic bags at grocery stores and convenience stores in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>Their idea：In Japan, 305 million plastic bags are used every year (300 bags/year for each person). Plastic bags take more than 1,000 years to decompose. Plan B is a reusable eco-bag that enables people to share / get benefit by using them.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 3. 「DiverCity」：Goal # 4 Quality Education</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Cx2-CIN1pMzQRtbD5TtX3Q.png" alt="『DiverCity』website prototype： https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/"><em>『DiverCity』website prototype： <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/">https://xd.adobe.com/view/7f7fb204-c645-4a24-99d8-d5487fe76871/</a></em></p>\n<p>Challenge: How can we design a solution that promotes respect for diversity and individual differences in Japanese schools?</p>\n<p>Their idea：DiverCity is a network of local people who have important life lessons they want to teach.

We encourage schools to set a specific day or time to think about diversity issues. They can make use of our “Diversity Bank” of local residents with interesting stories to tell. We also provide a “Diversity Pack” of lesson ideas and discussion topics for teachers introducing diversity education to their classrooms. Teachers and schools are free to decide how they implement Tayoubi, according to their available time and other resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 4. 「Sea You Soon」：Goal # 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*lVZc5xZXqvGMC5kn_jFbKg.png" alt="『SEA you soon』Mockup for an app service"><em>『SEA you soon』Mockup for an app service</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: How can we design a solution that turns Tokyo’s water resources into recreational community-building spaces while promoting awareness of the importance of water in our lives?</p>\n<p>Their idea：We provide easy access to coastal journeys with experienced fishermen through an app called “SEA you soon’’. One can experience catching fish and eating and cooking them with the locals. The aim is to give people an attachment to the coastal environment for a more sustainable waterfront development.</p>\n<p><strong>Team 5. 「Smart Mirror Companion」：Goal # 3 Good Health and Well-Being</strong></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*t5uL6jiHebslCy3XgXiCsQ.png" alt="『Smart Mirror Companion』Video prototype"><em>『Smart Mirror Companion』Video prototype</em></p>\n<p>Challenge: Combating the world’s health problems by focusing on well-being and making sure everyone has the tools and resources to be healthy.</p>\n<p>Their idea：A mirror powered by a digital personal assistant (like Siri) to be your partner when you need 1) medical assistance 2) or just a companion to be there for you.</p>\n<p>Aren’t these ideas great and inspiring? I know that these are not PERFECT perfect — because they were done only in 2 days — but it is surely the beginning of something exciting. Marco, the co-founder of Global Goals Jam, told me that it’s all about “Think BIG, start SMALL, act FAST!”, and I think it could not be phrased any better.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10368/1*cEMHeNs2OYedBQ-hwQrffg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>As a person who ALWAYS thinks of things in the context of cities and urbanism, I can’t help but think how valuable it would be to use this structure for the re-development of Tokyo. At the moment, everything seems to be “Think SMALL, start BIG, act SLOW!”. I’d love to apply the design sprint method we’ve learned during the Global Goals Jam to some of the critical urban problems we are facing, such as a shortage of childcare facilities, a lack of safe bicycle infrastructure, an unaffordable housing market, and energy shortages, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>I hope you can also come and join us for this year’s Global Goals Jam 2018 #Tokyo!</p>\n</section>\n'},"4kk+":function(e,t){},"524c":function(e,t,a){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0});var o=a("tvg5"),n=a("ShVG"),i=!1;var s=function(e){i||a("LHHF")},r=a("VU/8")(o.a,n.a,!1,s,"data-v-9e5686de",null);r.options.__file="pages/_city/_post.vue",t.default=r.exports},"52BU":function(e,t,a){var o={"./austin.json":"lVi9","./kuala lumpur.json":"K8CU","./nowhere.json":"sao2","./posts.json":"GTTH","./tokyo.json":"eGme"};function n(e){return a(i(e))}function i(e){var t=o[e];if(!(t+1))throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'.");return t}n.keys=function(){return Object.keys(o)},n.resolve=i,e.exports=n,n.id="52BU"},"5lll":function(e,t){e.exports={date:"12/12/2017",category:"essay",mapPosition:{location:"100Banch",bearing:0,center:[139.7047394,35.6559546],zoom:12,pitch:0}}},"9GoR":function(e,t){e.exports={date:"3/13/2018",category:"essay",mapPosition:{location:"100Banch",bearing:0,center:[139.7047394,35.6559546],zoom:12,pitch:0}}},"A+RZ":function(e,t,a){var o={"./static/posts/austin/CreativeReuse/content.md":"ozE+","./static/posts/austin/Introduction/content.md":"tnhe","./static/posts/austin/Mueller/content.md":"HKlI","./static/posts/austin/Seaholm_EcoDistrict/content.md":"i11p","./static/posts/kuala lumpur/alternativespot/content.md":"dGou","./static/posts/nowhere/Books/content.md":"lUE5","./static/posts/tokyo/HackMyCity/content.md":"cPJy","./static/posts/tokyo/globalgoalsjam17/content.md":"43NH","./static/posts/tokyo/renovationschooltokyo/content.md":"DZRx","./static/posts/tokyo/subjectivemapworkshop/content.md":"a1F/","./static/posts/tokyo/urbanistmeetuptokyo/content.md":"2hry"};function n(e){return a(i(e))}function i(e){var t=o[e];if(!(t+1))throw new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'.");return t}n.keys=function(){return Object.keys(o)},n.resolve=i,e.exports=n,n.id="A+RZ"},BdBf:function(e,t){e.exports={date:"5/9/1991",category:"essay",mapPosition:{location:"Shibuya",bearing:0,center:[139.70405059999996,35.6617773],zoom:12,pitch:0}}},DZRx:function(e,t){e.exports='<section><h1>What I learned at “Renovation School” in Tokyo</h1>\n<p><img src="/Renovationschool01.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p>Have you ever heard of the “Renovation School” in Japan?</p>\n<p>You might already know that Japan is experiencing a rapid degeneration due to the declining population. This decline raises a lot of social issues such as daycare, taxation and a critical labor shortage — and remarkably the increasing number of vacant homes, stores and abandoned infrastructure is part of the problem we are facing.</p>\n<p>In recent years, people have gradually started to realize that not using these vacant buildings in order to create something valuable for their communities is a waste. This is the reason why renovation is becoming increasingly popular as a way of urban intervention. It is an act of appreciating what we already have, and updating it to add new value so that it can fit the needs of our contemporary life and future.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the “renovation school” in Japan?</strong></h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F6PbXBfZ7E7dxPww99XMVw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>The Renovation School, originally started in Kyushu in 2011, is a d/4 days “place of practice” into which participants are divided into small units and come up with action plans to reuse the targeted vacant houses. Participants also need to think about business models to make the plans realistic and feasible. At the end, the participants then propose these plans to the real estate owners, aiming to bring these plans to fruition after school. Although it is called “school”, it’s not about the “learning”, but rather the “doing”.</p>\n<p>I heard about this movement when I lived in Copenhagen, and I’d been wanting to be part of it ever since. In 2017, I finally had an opportunity to participate in a 3-day Renovation School, which at this time focused on the Ikegami area, the south part of Tokyo. The school was under the sponsorship of the Tokyu Corporation — one of the major private railway companies and land developers in Japan — which I found it a little ironic, but I’ll talk more about that later in this post.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I try to explain what Renovation School in Japan is like, and how it (even though they never really articulate it as it is) uses a great design sprint method within the 3 days. I hope it also helps you understand a little bit where Japanese urbanism is heading.</p>\n<h2><strong>3 day design sprint to come up with the future of abandoned buildings in Tokyo</strong></h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the School, participants (by the way, even though it’s called “school”, most of us were not students but full time workers) were divided into small teams. Each team got to meet a house owner who owns a vacant building — they don’t know what to do with it. Our mission is to come up with a renovation plan and business model for that vacant building in order to give it a new life. I will quickly summarise what we have done in 3 days at the Renovation School.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*FTdpAiaS5TSc8OZtlSXeAQ.jpeg" alt="Day 1: UNDERSTANDING — Area Analysis &amp; Field work"><em>Day 1: UNDERSTANDING — Area Analysis &amp; Field work</em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Z_y6229J5g_nQ85ST3hyaA.jpeg" alt="This little building was our team’s assignment"><em>This little building was our team’s assignment</em></p>\n<p>The first day is all about input and developing an understanding of the area — these buildings are empty for a reason, right? It’s not like we can make WHATEVER in WHENEVER. No one wants to build a Disneyland in the middle of nowhere. If we don’t create shared knowledge and explore the problem from all angles under a shared brain, it’s extremely difficult to come up with a realistic plan — that’s why this first day of understanding is crucial during the Renovation School, we were told.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*q22-7jUckq3_ZNrTwgB56Q.jpeg" alt="Doing an interview with a local shop owner"><em>Doing an interview with a local shop owner</em></p>\n<p>This time’s focus area is called Ikegami, which is known as the last stop of the Tokyu Ikegami railway Line. The area has attracted many people since ancient times, as it is part of the path to the famous Ikegami Honmonji Temple. However, Ikegami is not an exception to the sad Japanese urban reality, that faces the population decline and the rising rate of vacancy.</p>\n<p>We spend the first day doing field work and intense desktop analysis, observing the people in the area and physical environment, as well as gathering data such as demography and learning about histories. We also conducted a lot of interviews with shop owners around our targeted vacant buildings.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*hLA_osE-ydxA9lfR-9e-ag.jpeg" alt="Day 2: SKETCH &amp; DECIDE — Brainstorming &amp; Synthesis / Idea Sketch"><em>Day 2: SKETCH &amp; DECIDE — Brainstorming &amp; Synthesis / Idea Sketch</em></p>\n<p>We gathered the memos of interviews, new findings obtained from field work,documents/materials to explain the history, demographic data etc — time for synthesis. The question to be asked is, of course, what is needed in this place? We had an intense brainstorming session to come up with the solicitations and we chose which ideas should be prototyped.</p>\n<p>Although there were countless ideas to reuse the vacant houses — such as making it a coworking space, cafe, private residence, etc…, it is likely that some of these ideas just don’t quite fit in certain places. We also need to think about the users and stakeholders, management and management systems too!</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*2FbZ5bN0u3ysuySqnY05iw.jpeg" alt="Day 3: PROTOTYPE AND VALIDATE"><em>Day 3: PROTOTYPE AND VALIDATE</em></p>\n<p>Finally we presented our idea in front of the building owners, landowner and developer, and of course, the locals and see how they interact with our ideas and get direct feedback from the target audience. Even though we had a great idea, we knew that the presentation for them is as important as coming up with solution ideas themselves — otherwise, who will give our ideas a chance?</p>\n<p>That was a rough summary of what we did during the 3 days, and below, I will share the three things that I learned from the renovation school.</p>\n<h2>1. Always think about the actual actors — we don’t need “faceless” proposals anymore</h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LlqstS4qGEzywR2mQx1Kfw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>The purpose of the renovation school is to make the ACTION plan, not the proposal itself. That is why the business model and the feasibility of the management system are quite important — otherwise, what’s the point of having a proposal?</p>\n<p>Our team members were full of ideas — renovating an empty building into a community center and inviting more people / would be amazing to have an bar inside so that people could gather and chill.But, then, who can proceed? When the question was returned, silence often spreads fast.</p>\n<p>When the question “who will do it?” remains ambiguous, only ideas are kept scattered, and at the end of all the good ideas just melt into air. It is necessary to thoroughly discuss the proposals that you really want to realize, a proposal that specifies actual actors.</p>\n<p>….but of course, it doesn’t mean that we can’t “dream” about all the nonsense.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. The importance of interdisciplinality</strong></h2>\n<p>Traditionally, specific experts such as urban planning experts, architects, real estate agents and developers have stipulated the way the city is. However, as society became more complicated nowadays, our citizens are responsible for the way the town is. I believe it is through interdisciplinary cooperation that we can unbind ourselves from the framework of specialised fields. I always find it very suggestive that Jane Jacobs is neither an architect nor an academic researcher.</p>\n<p>The second thing I learned at the renovation school was exactly this interdisciplinary collaboration. In my team (there were 9 of us in total), there was a designer, banker (!), architects, researcher, and media expert as well as a public officials, all different genders and ages. Everybody had different background and beliefs, and for that reason, there were some moments of conflicts and disagreement, I wouldn’t say it was easy — but isn’t this “chaos” itself is what we have in cities?</p>\n<h2>3. Tell the “story” of a place</h2>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-ajaFFE61gXQgzQC4qrGUQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*glF4I-KZbVvqVXdMrfuseA.jpeg" alt="I love these small details of everyday life inTokyo"><em>I love these small details of everyday life inTokyo</em></p>\n<p>In the Renovation School, as mentioned above, each team gets one existing empty house/building to work on a proposal for. I was taught at the school that we need to add “personality” or, let’s say, “story” to the place, instead of calling it a property — which sounds too static and impersonal.</p>\n<p>If there is no concept or a story that people can sympathise with, as a place where there is nothing to be changed anywhere, new values ​​and the like are not born from there. If you want to create a place that you want to carry your feet, you should scoop out features like characters and characters that stand out from that place and languages ​​together with stories that everyone can sympathise.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*X_6eTYhXJiEi2zl30Pgx_A.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>So…after those intense 3 days, I still ask myself — what is my role in making cities more livable and sustainable? What will happen to Japanese cities in the future? Even though the rate of vacant houses are still rising, most of the big developers in Japan, including Tokyu-Corporation (the organizer of the renovation school for this time), keep constructing new fancy buildings for urban redevelopment. I see an irony here. After spending 3 days of very intense design sprint, I couldn’t stop but hope to see more of those collective actions in Japan, especially NOW when urban development is booming before the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020.</p>\n<p>Let’s just hope that these new urban movements, such as the Renovation School, could shift the direction of Japanese urban development a little bit towards a better tommorow.</p>\n</section>\n'},GTTH:function(e,t){e.exports=[{slug:"Seaholm_EcoDistrict",city:"austin",title:" Seaholm EcoDistrict - Austin's sustainable urban renewal",description:" \nSeaholm EcoDistrict is an 85-acre urban development on the edge of downtown - it once used to be the city-owned power plant and a water treatment facility.

It was my first journey to Thailand and I didn’t have any prior knowledge about the city. For the first few days we visited the major famous temples and markets etc., all the touristic spots for which you can easily find information on Google or in guidebooks. However, I knew that something was missing.</p>\n<p>I appreciate local culture and the daily life that is lived and constantly being updated by the people who live there. For me. it is far more meaningful to visit a local community center than to over-spend in an expensive restaurant in a touristic city center.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google Maps couldn’t give me what I wanted, even with intensive research. What changed my stay in Bangkok was this beautiful map, which I found by change at a local creative space called<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/the-jam-factory-bangkok.htm"> the Jam Factory Bangkok</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*3-F6ftwV93Il-X92VEL3pw.jpeg" alt="Image by Nancy Chandler’s Thailand"><em>Image by <a href="http://nancychandler.net/nancychandlersblog.html">Nancy Chandler’s Thailand</a></em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2812/1*RQO6j2U2r-_RKhTKMS9IHw.jpeg" alt="Image by Nancy Chandler’s Thailand"><em>Image by <a href="http://nancychandler.net/nancychandlersblog.html">Nancy Chandler’s Thailand</a></em></p>\n<p>What’s so special about this map, with its excellent hand-drawing, is that it appears very… let’s say “biased” in a good way. Sure, there are some objective facts written on it, such as the names of the temples and so on, but you can really feel the presence of a map maker who has walked through and “felt” specific parts of the city in their own way. It talks about all the seemingly “useless” small things that you never read on Google Maps.</p>\n<p>It even reminds me of<a href="https://use-it.travel/home"> USE-It Map Europe</a>, which is an alternative map making movement for young travelers that I can never stop loving.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*0pebAn2aV90Qgx02TNKdAw.png" alt="USE-it Map Europe: https://use-it.travel/home"><em>USE-it Map Europe: <a href="https://use-it.travel/home">https://use-it.travel/home</a></em></p>\n<h2>No map is neutral</h2>\n<p>Maps tell stories.</p>\n<p>We see maps on a daily bases: On our phones, in the stations, in guidebooks etc… to get from point A to B. People tend to think that the maps we see/use every day — especially digital maps like Google Maps — are something very logical and objective. We simply don’t question them. On the other hand, something like Nancy Chandler’s map of Bangkok, which contains personal opinions, feelings, and memories, might be judged as “illogical”.</p>\n<p>But is it really so black and white?</p>\n<p>In fact, we can’t trust these “logical maps” as a pure “fact” either.</p>\n<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhLrEAgeMs4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n<p>This brilliant talk by Monica Stephens teaches us to be more critical about what digital maps (and analogue maps, even though they aren’t mentioned in the talk) are showing us. I won’t summarize her argument here in detail, but her message is clear — our maps are different based on our world view. And we should wonder whose world view and whose perception we are seeing on the maps, and whose perspective has been left out.</p>\n<p>For instance, the Mercator projection has famously been criticized for spreading a western-oriented world view, and there is an extreme inequality of the distribution of spatial information/data that covers the Earth’ surface.</p>\n<p>This is why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vow11HYG7HQ">Henk van Houtum</a> in his TED talk powerfully calls for the need to make new maps, to free the map from politics and emancipate it from the dominant world view — and make it our own.</p>\n<h2>Subjective Map Workshop</h2>\n<p>What if we each had our OWN map, one that didn’t get filtered by Google Maps and someone else’s world view? What if we had maps that talked about the small, local details that are otherwise left out by mainstream map making?</p>\n<p>With this motivation, some of my colleagues and I decided to throw a subjective map workshop in different parts of Tokyo — and we chose Shibuya as the first location.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*Y5VEWsyb4jqUD-L-nSpexg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*j-2SLsrfImpoOnShuKhmkA.png" alt="The idea was to collect multiple ideas and combine them together, and to make it sharable with others!"><em>The idea was to collect multiple ideas and combine them together, and to make it sharable with others!</em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*_-DTBn1Rn-Yz0gMlfSaHIg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>At the beginning, we learned map making techniques and the storytelling power of maps. Afterwards we just simply went out onto the streets for individual fieldwork, and wrote down our personal stories or opinions through own perspectives. For those who didn’t know what to do, I advised them to pay attention to personal memories and any attachments to a specific part of the city as well as sense of belonging, tips to enjoy favorite spots, even smell, sense of security, light and darkness, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*KsTcVBNtuqS1-1lLIGXjMQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9216/1*oJumCUy_D-wUo3VUr6X64g.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*UjejxhR8H7GlttxJ5Hjggw.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*aHOJjlyLmGAcIGlTtX3JIA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3936/1*KmPmDAS_Gv6CNZ7sDYdrzA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*ql9zdw-89dY9Ryj1d_Xg0w.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*qxQCHCVW_bdPtEAUeYROLQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*Z_WiLJ8K6tBT4vIYhJ1uhg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*RlymD5GP9noaz_Wm5gruTA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*Gy5b52e0pxKukD_Y-ASMBQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*5G7fWTZmHYj_LbljUSE0cg.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5248/1*ocdUV80pTplvLur7N0Mq0Q.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3936/1*TfiujDfr6H36n5q321e_QA.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<h2>This is the result. And what’s next?</h2>\n<p>In the end we had some incredibly fun and creative maps that were directly related to their creators’ personal ways of making sense of the urban surroundings.</p>\n<p>This is just one of the examples from the participants.

This is an attempt to give a long-term effect ( XL) in a short-term small practice (XS).</p>\n<p>The project has been doing various activities since 2013,from<a href="http://shibuyahack.com/2017/07/streetfurnitureinchuogai/"> making street furniture</a> to<a href="http://shibuyahack.com/2018/02/ese_shibuya_exhibition/"> organising an art exhibition</a> ; however, there has been a clear distance between it and the mainstream urban regeneration that is happening in Shibuya.</p>\n<p>Thus, we wanted to tackle the question of how we can connect the small-scaled bottom-up citizen initiatives with large-scale urban developments, which tend to leave the grassroots initiatives behind. It also involves the question of how we can make sense of the distance between our everyday lives and actions and the meta-scaled narrative and representation of Tokyo.</p>\n<p>This post briefly covers the discussion we had that day.</p>\n<p>※<em>This post is based on:<a href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Floftwork.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2F20180313_hmc_report&amp;h=ATMB4AWkQqiqV6gUJLAJMpUWFMIkYB1JcKAdPhFCdrdxKIaCj31JlPZ4DgYwSoJSOTv8jeAnNRo3MM2KX-oG1Ij5SHuC9c6jVmXL_Pe8f7gxj6HjMcFW_w3hLh8"> https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*IEAJ4RS-SlSJcmKu.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Floftwork.com%2Fjp%2Fevent%2F20180313_hmc_report&amp;h=ATMB4AWkQqiqV6gUJLAJMpUWFMIkYB1JcKAdPhFCdrdxKIaCj31JlPZ4DgYwSoJSOTv8jeAnNRo3MM2KX-oG1Ij5SHuC9c6jVmXL_Pe8f7gxj6HjMcFW_w3hLh8">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2><strong>What if there is the opposite to “broken window theory?”</strong></h2>\n<p>I know that “connecting various urban practices across scales” sounds a bit ambitious , so let me break it down a little bit more to show you what we had in mind.</p>\n<p>We started from the image of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0">*Powers of Ten</a>*” , a film by Charles and Ray Eames. It illustrates the world — from everyday picnics to cosmic mystery and even to the level of a carbon atom — as an arena of continuity. It is a work that travels from the viewpoint of XL to that of XS, and has exponential powers to emphasize the importance of scale.</p>\n<p>Another example; the broken windows theory was proposed by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982. Iit is the theory that uses broken windows as a metaphor/indicator showing disorder and the decay of neighborhoods. If there is one broken window in the town, this will lead to another being broken and another, which ultimately leads to arise in the crime rate of the town as a whole, and finally linking to urban disorder and incivility within a community.</p>\n<p>The broken window theory is a negative example, but it certainly highlights the importance of scales — the world as an arena of continuity. What if we can design the opposite phenomenon to the broken window theory by connecting various urban practices to achieve abigger effect?</p>\n<p>Below are some of the quotes from the guest speakers on this topic.</p>\n<h2><strong>Citizens who use and update their cities — Yukako Ishikawa</strong></h2>\n<p>Yukako Ishikawa, a director of Shibuya Hack Project, said that the “broken window theory” has a lot in common with tactical urbanism , which is the approach that this project is taking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Our motivation is to encourage the XS size bottom-up approach by citizens, who are often disconnected by large scale urban development by the administration or private companies. We need a common language to find a familiar arena between the two different scales.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6nGHIonXubV8o5Oi.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<h2><strong>Citizens’ everyday lives (XS) in the urban community — Jun Aoki (Nest.inc)</strong></h2>\n<p>Mr. Aoki, a famous landlord in Japan, believes that the smallest unit of our urban space is the residents’ everyday lives and their living space. In Aoki’s rental housings, the residents can make home gardens and organize events by themselves or create shared offices and customize their homes as they want — something that is quite rare in Japan.</p>\n<p>He has also devoted himself to revitalizing<a href="https://goo.gl/T6PdXf"> Minami-Ikebukuro Park</a>, which was re-opened in spring 2016 after five years of renovations. This park is now a popular hangout and lunch spot for locals with various activities such as Marche, film screenings, and weddings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The place of living should be connected to a community and its surroundings — we can scale up from XS to S by letting people have freedom to use their living space and sort of encroach towards their urban surroundings.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*bVxnUYJ7s7fs4eIo.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2><strong>“Urban management” as a way to connect the various urban scales — Atsumi Hayashi (Tokyo R Real Estate)</strong></h2>\n<p>Mr. Hayashi, co-chairman of<a href="https://www.realtokyoestate.co.jp/"> Tokyo R Real Estate</a> and the architecture firm<a href="http://www.speac.co.jp/"> SPEAC</a> argues the importance of applying the concept of management into cities as a way to include the industrial strategies and human resources and other manageable factors to establish a creative place in microscopic thinking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It is important to have strategies and management skills to concern the large-scaled regional socio-economic sustainability while putting people first and believing in the power of smallness led by the citizens.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*MQwXhTbCz6Q-fI4y.jpg" alt="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report"><em><a href="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report">https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20180313_hmc_report</a></em></p>\n<h2>Workshop</h2>\n<p>The event also involved fieldwork to the riverside in Shibuya and a subsequent workshop.
