# Arcosanti, an experimental urban laboratory and "ideal" city

Few weeks ago I had a great opportunity to visit [Arcosanti](https://arcosanti.org/) in central Arizona, 110 km north of Phoenix. It is known as an experimental town originally proposed by the Italian-American architect, Paolo Soleri (1919–2013).

## Soleri’s life-long pursuit of “arcology”

It felt almost surreal to visit this experimental town in the middle of nowhere - our car suddenly veered off the highway and went to unpaved gravel path.

48 years after the Soleri's first construction in 1970, this 25 acres-wide land has developed as an independent 'town' with a community of architects and urban designers who are influenced by Soleri's legacy - there are still around 80 people living in Arcosanti, actively engaging in the realization of the plan.

The goal of Arcosanti is to explore the concept of 'arcology' - which combines architecture and ecology - in a way to pursue the improvement of urban conditions while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth.

## Living urban laboratory - still a long way to go

As mentioned there is still a community there, even after Soleri’s alleged sexual abuse on his own daughter and the whole plan had suspended.

During the tour within Arcosanti, we are informed that this desert “utopia” still attracts many curious architects, designers and artists from all over the world - the community currently represents over 10 nationalities. The requirement for residency includes participation on a serious of workshops and active engagement of community.

It was quite interesting to see how people live and engage with their neighbours.
