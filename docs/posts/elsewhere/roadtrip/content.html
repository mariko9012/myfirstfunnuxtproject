<p>Recently I got to know that my phone has detailed location</p>
<p>At first I was a little bit surprised that there are not so many exciting personal map projects/examples out there that are based on personal location data from Google Map.</p>
<p>However, I managed to find some tutorials/services to create my own travel map based on Google location data, and this post is a memorandum of my creation/learning process. I also checked <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://carto.com/blog/eighty-data-visualizations-examples-using-location-data-maps/#sites">some inspirational maps</a> that are also based on various location data, which motivated me and pushed me forward even when I encountered some techinical problems and felt like hitting my head to a wall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreword</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, you can easily check <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb">your Google Maps Timeline</a> online - you can choose the date etc and it's very fun (or creepy) to look at to begin with. However, I wanted to visualize data from certain period of time with my own design. In this case it's always better to download the data itself and use the other mapping methods/softwares such as <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> or <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>. You can download the data easily from <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">here</a> in JSON format.</p>
<p>Here are the three different ways that I tried to visualize my location data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert JSON file to CSV, and simply throw data into <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a></li>
</ol>
<p>For this method followed the steps from [this Medium post](Visualizing Your Google Location History).</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the data</li>
<li>Cleaning the data</li>
<li>Use Carto</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Visualize Google Location History using R</li>
</ol>
<p>I referred to <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://medium.com/@tejasrr19/visualize-your-google-location-history-a2343b14a6fe">this article</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Visit</li>
</ol>
<p>I found a interesting service called <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://v.isits.in/">visits</a>, in which you can simply upload your LocationHistory.json file (without conversion/cleaning!) and it creates super fun visualization for you.</p>

<p>One circule indicate one stay, meaning that the bigger the circle gets, the longer your stay were.</p>
<p><img src="roadtrip03" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the cool thing about this visualization is that you can define place size (street/neighborhood/city/region etc..). For instance, you can click on one city, and see which neighborhood/street you spent more time in.</p>
<p>It is also connected with Flickr,</p>
