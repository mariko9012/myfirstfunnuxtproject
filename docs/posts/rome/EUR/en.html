<p>Rome's new city centre EUR</p>
<p>After visiting an ocean of ancient ruins and historical builigs in Rome, an simple quiestion came to my mind — what are Rome's new urban developments look like? /////.</p>
<p>That's why we visited EUR, a district located on the edge of Rome’s historical center. EUR stands for Esposizione Universale Roma; it was originally planned in the 1930s as the site for the 1942 world's fair which Benito Mussolini, to showcase twenty years of Fascism in Italy.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The world fair never happened though, due to the intervening of World War II. The site</p>
<p>he uncompleted EUR development suffered severe damage<br>
However, the Roman authorities decided that EUR could be the basis of an out-of-town business district, which other capitals did not begin planning until decades later (for example, London Docklands and La Défense near Paris). Therefore, during the 1950s and 1960s the unfinished Fascist-era buildings were completed and other new buildings were built in contemporary styles for use as offices and government buildings, set in large gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Our impressions</h2>
<p>First thing we've noticed was the uncomfortable number of cars. We decided to take a metro from downtown and explor the district by foot, as some of the articles about EUR I found on Google boldly state that it's walkable. Let me tell you, it is NOT.</p>
<p>The distric streached out perfectly symettrical from a central road. ///. and it makes the park almost impporisble to reach or get out without being hit by a car.</p>
<p>The design was inspired, according to the fascist ideology, by Roman Imperial town planning,[5] with modern elements which came from Italian rationalism, the result being a sort of simplified neoclassicism.<br>
, built mainly of limestone, tuff and marble, traditional materials associated with Roman Empire architecture.</p>
<p>It doesn’t quite feel right to enjoy architecture and urban design that both departs from Rome’s classical and Renaissance icons and has its genesis in a totalitarian state. Like many examples of early 20th century design in Italy, one must separate the form from the ideology. However, there is solace in that many of the buildings were completed after WWII, that the site was home to 1960 Olympics events, and the district became a natural place to expand housing, educational and government facilities for the new democracy.</p>

<h2>Nazizm, new Italy and nostalgia</h2>
<p>Museo della Civiltà Romana<br>
the copies of Trajan’s Column bas relief panels which allow you to follow the story of the Roman Emperor’s Dacian Wars victories like a giant graphic novel (the original is located at Trajan’s Forum near Piazza Venezia), and an amazing 1:250 scale model of Imperial Rome,</p>
<p>the Palazzo dei Congressi<br>
a modern interpretation of the Pantheon by architect Adalberto Libera.</p>
<p>Viale della Civiltà Lavoro to EUR’s highlight<br>
the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Known as the Colesseo Quadrato (square coliseum), it is perhaps the most widely-known representation of Fascist architecture, with its particular kind of neo-classic style.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that many Roman professionals and families make their home in the EUR – it’s accessible and full of modern amenities.<br>
EUR is the headquarters of many companies and public bodies,</p>
<p>I couldn't really enjoy due to its unwalkability and 　 Awkward 　 nostalgia<br>
It left me with a bit of bitter taste</p>
