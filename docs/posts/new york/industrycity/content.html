<p><a href="https://industrycity.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Industry City</a> is the century-old industrial complex located on the waterfront in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

<h3>Fear of gentrification in Sunset Park</h3>
<p>In 2013, <a href="http://www.jamestownproperties.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Jamestown</a>, the developer that owns Chelsea Market, and its partners bought a 50 percent stake in the 16-building complex. Covering six million square feet, the derelict warehouses were formerly known as Bush Terminal and were built by the industrial tycoon Irving T. Bush in the 1890s.</p>
<p>As in SoHo, Dumbo and countless other New York neighborhoods, gentrification is coming to Sunset Park.</p>
<p>In 2017, Industry City, a collection of 16 massive warehouses located on the neighborhood’s western edge, announced a proposal to rezone its campus, which at six million square feet is already the largest privately owned industrial complex in New York City. As part of its ongoing $1 billion plan to reshape the property, Industry City’s rezoning proposal seeks to create 1.3 million square feet of new commercial and industrial space by allowing its owners to erect several new buildings that will also house hotels, an academic campus, retail spaces, and parking.</p>
<p>As Industry City gears up for rezoning, locals question who will benefit<br>
A rezoning proposal seeks to create 1.3 million square feet of new commercial and industrial space</p>
<p>Many community members in Sunset Park have been alarmed by this rezoning proposal. After being acquired by Belvedere Capital and Jamestown in 2013, the initial phases of redevelopment at Industry City have helped to spur a wave of real estate speculation throughout the neighborhood, where rents and home prices have skyrocketed. Local residents are fearful that these new proposed changes would supercharge the gentrification which is already threatening to engulf the neighborhood.</p>
<p>which encouraged New Yorkers to relocate to Sunset Park for its “affordable prices and low-key vibe.” It is little wonder that local residents are worried about Industry City’s proposed expansion.</p>

<h3>A little bit about history</h3>
<p>Founded in the early 1900s, Bush Terminal was the first facility of its kind in New York City and the largest multi-tenant industrial property in the United States.</p>
<p>During World War I, Bush Terminal was used as a United States Navy base, though it returned to private ownership after the war.</p>
<p>The surrounding area entered a period of decline after World War II,</p>
<p>Today, Industry City comprises roughly 35 acres (14 ha) of the former Bush Terminal, including 16 former factory buildings between 32nd and 41st Streets built in the early 20th century, and houses tenants in six million square feet of industrial and commercial space. Since 2011, the complex has been undergoing renovations to modernize the historic infrastructure. A major expansion of Industry City, which would add 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2) of space to the complex, was announced in 2017. The section of Bush Terminal operated by the NYCEDC is also undergoing a renovation into the &quot;Made in NY&quot; campus, a film, TV, and fashion manufacturing complex that is set to open in 2020.</p>
