<p>We are used to see &quot;Little -&quot; neighrbouhood in most of the western cities. Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Little Greece just to name a few. In this context, Little L.A. doesn’t scream out at you at first.</p>
<p>In Mexico, a large number of deportees from the United States are beginning to have an effect on the capital. And with the fate of some 800,000 undocumented migrants brought to America as children currently up in the air, the number of deportees may rise sharply.</p>

<p>It’s located next to a large plaza, in the center of which is an historic arch commemorating the Mexican Revolution. In the evening, groups of Mexicans gather in the plaza for outdoor exercise classes while teenagers compete in rap battles. Despite the historic nature of the neighborhood, it’s definitely undergoing a big change.</p>
<p>The genesis of the nickname “Little L.A.” is unclear. Most people say it caught on a couple of years ago after the opening of a massive bilingual call center on one corner of the plaza. Mexicans in their 20s and 30s who grew up in the U.S. began working there because they spoke English. In between shifts, they hung out in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Over the years, more and more U.S.-raised Mexicans began hanging out in the neighborhood. Many say they liked being around other people with similar histories and cultural references. Businesses started popping up that catered to them, like a burrito stand – while burritos are popular in the U.S., they are largely not eaten in Mexico City – and a barbershop that specialized in fades popular in the U.S.</p>

<p>“It feels like a piece of the United States… We feel more comfortable because we are talking English, talking about life, and trying to support each other,”</p>
