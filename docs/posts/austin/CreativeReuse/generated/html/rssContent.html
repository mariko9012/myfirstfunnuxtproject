<p>I found this little place called <a href="https://austincreativereuse.org/">Austin Creative Reuse</a>, which is run by a nonprofit organization that collects, sells, and distributes donated articles. They focus on a community building for smarter purchase and consumption decisions.</p>
<p>They've got everything - from old playing cards to used textiles - and you can get almost everything under 1$. It's not the affordable price that makes this place special and fun though - what's fun for me is the fact that I could see the random 'materials' and texture of the city in this place.</p>
<p>All the used objects that are collected by the locals tell a lot about the previous owners, their tastes and trends of that time. It is also fun to see how these objects are creatively reused by school children and artists etc.</p>
<p>I highly recommend a visit!</p>
