<p>There is absolutely no better way to relax after a long day than soaking in a hot good <em>sento</em> - Japanese traditional public bath. While hundreds of <em>sento</em> have closed their business in the past decades due to deterioration and lack of successors, there is still a good chance to stumble across a local <em>sento</em> in <a href="https://www.city.kyoto.lg.jp/tokei/cmsfiles/contents/0000057/57538/1shou.pdf" target="_blank" class="external">Kyoto's neighrbouhoods</a>. They are often small, absolutely local, and (I personally think) architecturally beautiful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there have recently been people who are putting much effort into the conservation of <em>Sento</em> - thanks to them, some of the <em>sento</em> still maintain to be a social hub even after the closure of their business. In the past, a <em>sento</em> was simply a place to bathe - these days, however, there are some intriguing renovation projects in favor of preserving their architectural, cultural values while injecting new life and function into it.</p>

<p>Amongst some interesting <em>sento</em> in Kyoto (Such as <a href="https://www.tsunagujapan.com/live-music-while-bathing-in-a-sento-check-out-sauna-no-umeyu/" target="_blank" class="external">Ume-yu</a>), I've recently come across <a href="https://kujoyu.com/rentalspace/" target="_blank" class="external">Kujoyu</a> and fell in love with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://kujoyu.com/rentalspace/" target="_blank" class="external">Kujoyu</a> had been in business since mid-1920 as <em>sento</em> until they closed down 10 years ago. Unlike many other public baths that were out of business, the owner of the buildings saw value in a traditional wooden building and decided to renovate it as an open event space.</p>
<p>It is located in a residential neighborhood in the southern part of Kyoto, which has long been considered as a run-down, &quot;out of proper-Kyoto&quot; area. It is rather hard to find, but it is definitely worth visiting to experience how new spirits and culture can live in an old structure.</p>

<p>Some parts are still in the same shape as it was back then - bathtubs, a weighing machine, sinks and fans, and a clerk counter. There is just no water in the bathtubs, but you can still enjoy its nostalgic feeling.</p>

<p>It simply breaks my heart that <em>sento</em> is a disappearing species, but it is also true that there are a considerable amount of projects all over Japan to develop and update the tradition by adding new values while preserving the original structure. I also like <a href="https://sentozukai.jp/" target="_blank" class="external">this book</a> that has countless illustrations of different <em>sento</em> to capture the magical charm of this Japanese tradition.</p>
