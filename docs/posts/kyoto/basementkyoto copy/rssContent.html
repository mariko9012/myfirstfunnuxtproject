<em>Vostok Kyoto, a studio for artists located in Nishijin area.</em></p>
<p>Japan's contemporary art scene used to be dominated by Tokyo until recently and there wasn't even enough information about art communities in the other part of the country. Things have changed, and Japan's best art destinations include smaller cities and the countryside. Kyoto's art community recently started burgeoning and is uniquely updating the cultural landscape of the city.</p>
<p>We recently got a chance to visit <a href="https://vostok-kyoto.jimdofree.com/about-1/">Vostok Kyoto</a>, one of the art residencies that are organized by <a href="http://basementkyoto.jp/">Basement Kyoto</a>. During the interview with the members of Basement Kyoto, we learnt about thier methodology for using abandon buildings to breathe new life into them to support the artist comunity in Kyoto.</p>

<h2>Providing a white canvas to artists</h2>
<p>&quot;In Kyoto, artists are always in need of findng a good place to stay and work. There are actually many artist here, but we don't have enough creative spaces in the heart of the city.&quot; says Yoshitaka Yazu, an artist and one of the organisers of Basement Kyoto.</p>

<p>We've already wrote <a href="">here</a> about how strict Japanese rent regulations are and how hard it is to freely customise a place you rent. It could easilly be suffocating for people with creative minds, who need to personalize thier space based on specific needs.</p>
<p>Basement Kyoto functiona as a mediator between artists and houseowners, in order to cretae spaces where artist can live and work while making thier own space as if it is part of thier art work. The space functions as a foundation and base material for artist to work on, just like a whilte canvas. The spaces they rent are customized freely by artists themselves - again, this is quite rare in Japan.</p>
<p>On top of that, Japan has recetlty been facing the increasing number of vacant homes, stores and abandoned infrastructure. Urban flight, depopulation have left millions of homes vacant in their cities. According to a report by <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/nhknewsline/numbersoftheday/2017062601/">the Nomura Research Institute</a> nearly a third of all homes in the country – 21.7 million – could be abandoned by 2033. To tackle this issue, a project called <a href="https://kariage-japan.com/kariageta/980/">Kariage</a> started to rent some old buidings from the owners, renovate them, and pass them on to those who appriciate thier values. Basement Kyoto is a project that <a href="https://kariage-japan.com/kariageta/980/">applis this methodology</a> in the context of art in Kyoto.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like a white canvas, our spaces complete once artists move in and started making them thier own. we have multiple locations in different parts of the city, and all of them have different characters and funtionality. Eventually we want to connect all of them like underground water to create more meaningful impact on the city.&quot; says Yuki Kosai, a member of Basement Kyoto from TANK.inc.</p>
<h2>The key is to connect with house owners with creative mind and cultural literacy</h2>

<p>How do they manage to find good real estate properties in the city, though? In Kyoto, where there is still ///, there are many properties that are not officially on a market. &quot;Actually, it's building owners who usually approach us, not the opposite. They are often intersted in arts, want to be close to it, but they don't know what to do. They are always very supportive for our project - Kyotois are culturally well educated and we are always impressed by it.&quot; says Mitsuhiro Sakakibara.</p>
<p>&quot;We always go around a neighrbohood to say hello to neighrbs before starting a construction. Kyoto is historically a place where artists, sculptors, carpenters, and artisans in various fields were employed by the court or the shrines and temples. That might be the reason why they have no aversion to art studios and workshop spaces.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyoto has seen the development of great artists over its history of more than 1,200 years. They will keep expanding thier network and build more locations in the different parts of Kyoto, contributing both the futher development of the arctist community and urban metabolism of Kyoto.</p>
