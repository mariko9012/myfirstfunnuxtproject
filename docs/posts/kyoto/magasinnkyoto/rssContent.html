<p>Walking around Kyoto, I've noticed a number of new guesthouses and hostels popping up every so often. At the same time, I can't help but noticing posters and signs that say &quot;No more guest house&quot;, which are clearly written by long-time residents in Kyoto.</p>
<p>The city of Kyoto saw record levels of tourists in 2018, with 15.57 million foreign and Japanese visitors spending at least one night in the former capital of Japan. <a href="https://www.tourism.jp/en/tourism-database/stats/">The number</a> continuously is rising, marking 2,604,300 visits sorely in a month in February 2019. There is no doubt about a reason behind the boost of new guesthouses.</p>
<p>Should the relationship between hotels/hostels and local residences be so bad, though? Moreover, can hotels/hostels be more than a fuctional space of spending nights - can we argue the potentioal of these spaces as social, active, /// hub of the city? I was curious.</p>
<p>I asked // from MAGASINN KYOTO, a unique hostel in the area just North of Nijo Castle. MAGASINN KYOTO is ///.</p>

<p>A cultural hub in Kyoto<br>
&quot;One might think that people are exclusive and conservative in a historic city life Kyoto. But I am always surprised by the beautiful mix of cultures and genres, old and new. I am trying to make this place a hub of cultures.&quot; says ///</p>

<h2>Kyoto (京都の場所性、地域住民との交流のプロセス)</h2>
<p>&quot;I have worked in Tokyo for years before moving into Kyoto. You can often find neighborly ties and small communities in Kyoto, which I find very interesting.&quot;</p>

→ ただホテル事業者としやるのではなく、自分で入っていく。町内会長もやる。回覧板も配る。目つきが違う。<br>
→ 街に入っていくとやりやすくなる。空き家が出ると友達に紹介できる</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I still haven't seen many critical studies or experiments on the topic of hotels, hostels and other touristic facilities in our city, and thier imapct on local cultrue and community.</p>
