<p>There is absolutely no better way to relax than soaking in a hot good <em>sento</em> - Japanese traditional public bath. While hundreds of sento have closed thier business in the past decades, there is still a good chance to stumble across a local <em>sento</em> in Kyoto's neighrbouhoods. They are small, local, and architecturally beatifull. It simply breaks my heart that <em>sento</em> is a dissapring spieces.</p>
<p>However, Some of the <em>sento</em> maintain to be a social hub even after they closure of thier business. In the past, a <em>sento</em> was simply a place to bathe - These days, however, there are some interesting renovation projects that preserves its architectural, cultural value and breathe new life into it.</p>

<h1>Kujoyu - From nostalgia to</h1>
<p><a href="https://kujoyu.com/rentalspace/">Kujoyu</a> was a <em>sento</em> that opened earyly 昭和時代 and closed down 10 years ago. The owner of the buildings saw a value in a traditional woodenbudiling and decided to renovate it as an open event space.</p>
<p>Some parts are still in the same shape as it was back then - Bathtabs, a weighing machine, sinks and fans. There is just no water in the bathtabs, but you can sill enjoy its nostalgic feeling.</p>

<h1>Public bath culture in Japan</h1>
<p>It is located in a residential neighrborhood and is rather hard to find, but it is definitely worth visiting to experiece how new spirits and culture can live in a old structure.</p>
