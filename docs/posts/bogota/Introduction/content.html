<p>When it comes to Bogota, I only watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757707/" target="_blank" class="external">Cities on Speed: Bogota Change (2009)</a> and knew only a little bit about the famous mayor Enrique Peñalosa - my kwnoledge of the city was quite limited. Luckily I had a local architect friend who was kind enough to walk through the city with me with a full of local tips. Here are the list of things I learned from the talented Columbian architect Ricardo Torres Gomez, as well as things I found by myself about the capital of Columbia.</p>
<h3>Things to do, places to go</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.greenroofs.com/projects/parque-bicentenario-bogota/" target="_blank" class="external">Parque Bicentenario</a> is an urban park in the heart of Bogota, which was one of our first spots to stop with Ricardo. Designed by a Columbian architect <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/office/giancarlo-mazzanti" target="_blank" class="external">Giancarlo Mazzanti</a> and inaugurated in 2016, Parque Bicentenario passes over Avenida El Dorado, one of the major vehicular arteries in Bogota. The city was (and still is) divided between the north part and the south, creating serious polarization and social inqueality - this park was thus designed in a hope to create natural connectivities and revitalize downtown.</p>

<p>I personally think <a href="https://www.biblored.gov.co/bibliotecas/biblioteca-virgilio" target="_blank" class="external">Biblioteca Virgilio</a> is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful libraries in the world. It was designed by a famous Colombian architect <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogelio_Salmona" target="_blank" class="external">Rogelio Salmona</a>. The building has a fascinating circular structure, carefully designed to create a seamless landscape with the surrounding park and fountains.</p>

<p>Every Sunday in Bogota, you can enjoy car free <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/9/13017282/bogota-ciclovia-open-streets" target="_blank" class="external">Ciclovía</a></em>. 112km of roads that streaches from the south to the north are closed up for cars, allowing cyclists and runners to take over the streets. The program was created and promoted in the 1990s and early 2000s, under Bogotá Mayor Enrique Peñalosa and his brother Gil Peñalosa. Gil Peñalosa now has a non-profit organization called <a href="https://www.880cities.org/" target="_blank" class="external">880cities</a> that is entirely dedicated to the topic of urban mobility.</p>

<p>I usually avoid taking tours when I travel, but <a href="http://bogotagraffiti.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Bogota Graffiti Tour</a> was increadibly informative and definitely worth the time and money. They explain not only about the artistic elements of Bogota's Graffities, but also thier politics. Take a tour and visit Parque de la Candelaria to study the richness of thier art. By the way, there are various theories about the Graffities culture in this city, but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT true that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/30/bogota-graffiti-artists-mayor-colombia-justin-bieber" target="_blank" class="external">Justin Bieber's visit to Bogota opened doors for Colombian graffiti artists</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BD_Bacat%C3%A1" target="_blank" class="external">BD Bacatá</a> is the world's <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bd-bacata" target="_blank" class="external">first crowdfunded skyscraper</a> that sticks out in downtown Bogota, and also Colombia’s tallest building. They started the construction in 2011, and 8 years later in 2019, this tower is somehow still far from completion due to a finantial situation of a stakeholer. The buildings has a pensive look, waiting investors and residents to move in in the possible future.</p>

<p><a href="http://mikesbogotablog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Mike's Bogota Blog</a> might be a great introduction to the city from an urbanist's perspective. <a href="https://thebogotapost.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Bogota Times</a> is a good English resrouces to get a gist of the citym too.</p>

<p>Before visiting Bogota by myself, I always thought <a href="https://twitter.com/EnriquePenalosa?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" class="external">Enrique Peñalosa</a> was the coolest hero who saved Bogota from being &quot;the most dangerous city in the world&quot;. However, after talking to some local urbanists, I found out that it's not as black and white as that. It might be <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/blogs/95348-it-time-rethink-legacy-enrique-pe-alosa" target="_blank" class="external">time to Rethink the Legacy of Enrique Peñalosa?</a>, including his creation <a href="https://www.transmilenio.gov.co/" target="_blank" class="external">TransMilenio</a>.<br>

<p>Did you know that Le Corbusier came to Bogotá in 1947, and had <a href="http://www.lecorbusierenbogota.com/template.php?pg=includes%2Floslibros&amp;fbclid=IwAR0sxP_s8O2kCztJM2NraQkhYa3K8dubqom7Dl4t6tjM8Fxy8WBKiQ3UJHo" target="_blank" class="external">a master plan</a> for Columbia's capital city? It might be questionable if we could call Bogota as &quot;<a href="https://thecitypaperbogota.com/bogota/the-corbusier-city/3672" target="_blank" class="external">Le Corbusier City</a>&quot;, but it is surely interesting to look at the contrast between the urban development proposal of Le Corbusier to the current layout and reality of the city.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2369025/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl" target="_blank" class="external">La Playa DC</a> is an intersting movie that illustrates a life of Afro-Colombian teenager, whose family fled from the country's Pacific coast to Bogota due to the violence. I personally think the movie did a great job to depict exclusion and racism in the city.</p>
