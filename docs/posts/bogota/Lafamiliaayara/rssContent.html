<p>WUF9</p>
<p>One of the columbian urbansists I met during WUF9 introduced me the artist Don Popo during my stay in Bogota, Columbia. Don Popo, founder of an innovative organization La Familia Ayara, invited me with his whole team to share how he uses hip-hop culture to empower people living in violence and oppression in Columbia.</p>
<h2>La Familia Ayara</h2>
<p>Jeffer Renteria, known artistically as Don Popo, founded the organization La Familia Ayara more than 29 years ago, in order to use culture of hip hop to encourage inclusive participation and create social change in Columbia. They work closely with kids and women especially from poor, socially exluded &quot;barrios&quot; - neighrbouhooods in Bogota. They give them free claases and workshops of breakdance, rap, photography etc, as well as organizing some cultural events.</p>

<p>rap battle:<br>
&quot;Rap let them interpret thier relationship with the communiy, with the city, the institutions and all the problems that affect them. They talk about what happens at home, in the neighbourhood, in the street.&quot;</p>
<p>Poverty, social exclusion, violence</p>

<h2>Why culture matters</h2>
<p>Why hip-hop, why culture<br>
They are also egaer to open themselves up for other cultural forms and activities, not only hip-hop.</p>
<p>Thier methodologies could be applied in other cities and contexts as well, which opens up the potential of international collaboration.</p>

<h2>For a city without limits - don popo's political action</h2>
<p>Monday, March 4, DonPopo Ayara pre-registered his candidacy for the Bogota City Hall in the Cambio Radical Party. During the pre-registration, Don Popo Ayara addressed the main pillars that make up his plan to make Bogota a City Without Limits.</p>
<p>&quot;politics is connected to social, cultural aspect of society.&quot;</p>
<p>With more than 30 years of artistic life, he became one of the founding leaders of the urban movement in the city and through his social work for the vulnerable population, with children and adolescents in protection for physical, sexual and psychological abuse , with young people in jails and drug rehabilitation sites; the protection and empowerment of women, the building of networks of youth organizations, the vindication of the rights of ethnic groups in citizenship</p>
<p>”It's time to give a radical change to Bogotá. It is time to put a greater level of creativity at the service of the city. It is time to free Bogota and its inhabitants from the limits that have been putting us to block our ability to innovate and grow the city.&quot; - Por una ciudad sin límites (For the city without limit)</p>
<p>In addition, for 10 years he was one of the young leaders builders and spokesmen of the Safest Cities Program of UN Habitat, invited to be a speaker at the forums held in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya, and in Colombia cities such as Bogotá and Medellín.</p>
<p>The experience of DonPopo Ayara for over 23 years in social and cultural work in the construction of networks for political advocacy and citizen participation, in addition to its social origin and ethnicity are the essential ingredients that make it the ideal candidate to participate in the democratic exercise by the Mayor of Bogotá, promising to make this a free, moving, dynamic and competitive city.</p>
