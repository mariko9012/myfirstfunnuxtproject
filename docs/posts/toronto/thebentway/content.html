<p>There are <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2017/1/9/14183876/freeway-underpass-park-public" target="_blank" class="external">some successful urban projects</a> that turned ugly urban underpasses into fun, functioning public parks in North America. <a href="http://www.thebentway.ca/" target="_blank" class="external">The Bentway</a> in Toronto is a brand new 1.75 km linear park underneath the Gardiner Expressway through Toronto's Fort York neighbourhood, and it's worth visiting!</p>

<h2>Elevated highways and rail lines for adaptive reuse</h2>
<p>Many North American cities are now facing a question of what to do with thier ugly wasted space regarding to highways and rail lines - some created urban parks, some completely removed/ing freeways entirely. Since High Line opened in Manhattan in 2009, industrial reuse of highways and rail lines became one of the hottest toppics for creative development.</p>
<p>It is amazing to check out how cities are coverting thier much-hated past into something positive - The Bentway is now a community gathering place, with occatial community events and activities. It's also great for just taking a walk with your dog and have urban picnic. Who would have thought that we would be emjoying Sunday beer garden at ugly underpasses someday?</p>

<h2>Well integrated with the historic value of the neighrbouhood</h2>
<p>The Bentway is located in a historically important neighrbouhood in Toronto - <a href="https://www.fortyork.ca/" target="_blank" class="external">Fort York National Historic Site</a>. This is where</p>
<p>knits together seven local neighbourhoods with over 70,000 residents, becoming a gateway to the waterfront, while providing access to important attractions and destinations â€“ from Fort York National Historic Site,</p>
<p>The fort was built by the British Army and Canadian militia troops in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, to defend the settlement and the new capital of the Upper Canada region from the threat of a military attack, principally from the newly independent United States. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1923.</p>
<p>In 1793, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe authorized a garrison on the present site of Fort York, just west of the mouth of Garrison Creek on the north western shore of Lake Ontario. Simcoe recognized Toronto was an ideal site for settlement and defence because of its natural harbour and relative longer distance from the United States.<br>

<p>There are many more great example regarding to adaptive reuse of highways and rail lines. They often deal with highlt complex projects with different stakeholders, different souces of funding, and variety of interests. Yet, ///</p>
