## Organization

- [Global Cities Institute](http://www.globalcitiesinstitute.org) is initiated by the University of Toronto in [the Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design](https://www.daniels.utoronto.ca/). It deals with various urban data to calculate, analyze and visualize in order to seek for alternative and progressive forms of urbanization.

- A non-profit applied research organization [The Canadian Urban Institute](http://www.canurb.org/) has a variety of programs and educational events to join, with is developed around the theme of healthy urban development.

- If you have graduated from a Masters, LLB, JD or Ph.D. program within the last three years,[Toronto Urban Fellows](https://www.toronto.ca/home/jobs/information-for-applicants/recruitment-initiatives/toronto-urban-fellows/) by the city of Toronto could be your next very interesting career path.

- [Myseum of Toronto](http://www.myseumoftoronto.com/) is not like a regular museum - it’s every place in the city. You can participate Myseum programs all year long at exhibits, online, and at pop-up events around the city. I like it when they say "You are the “my” in Myseum", meaning that we can share our own stories, ideas, arts and music with them!
