<p><a href="https://havanatimes.org/?p=106918" target="_blank" class="external">Callejon de Hamel</a></p>
<p>It is one of the main centers of Afro-Cuban culture in Havana . Its history goes back to the years 1989-90, when this community cultural project began to take shape , which has resulted in a kind of open-air gallery where we can immerse ourselves in the Afro-Cuban culture.</p>

<h2>Salvador González Escalona</h2>
<p>To speak of the Callejón de Hamel is to speak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Gonz%C3%A1les_Escalona" target="_blank" class="external">Salvador González Escalona</a>, the Cuban sculptor and muralist who transformed this small alley to capture and spread the African origins of the Cuban identity . It all started when one of the neighbors in the alley asked him to paint the facade of his house.</p>
<p>Even though the first four years became difficult, he was inspired by local inhabitants and visitors to continue his work, and little by little, the street was transformed from a slum area to an enthusiastic Afro-Cuban centre.</p>
<p>Today there are workshops for young Cuban children to learn painting.</p>
<p>In these murals, the artist shows from a surreal and abstract point of view the mythical and magical essence of Afro-Cuban culture , as well as the lacks, desires and ambitions of the people living in the alley.</p>

<h2>Cayo Hueso district</h2>
<p>The surrounding Cayo Hueso neighbourhood once had a dangerous reputation, but Salvador’s art has helped to change perceptions of the area.</p>
<p>The place is a small alley and side street of Lazarostreet in Havana Centro, situated three blocks from the Hospital Hermanos Amerijeiras in the poor bario Cayo Hueso (Cayo Hueso district)<br>
The Callejon bears the name of a wealthy trader Fernando Hamel who maintained the entire (poor) district. Today it has become a place where the Afro Cuban art and Cuban traditions are practiced.</p>
<p>One of the first inhabitants of the alley was Fernando Belleau Hamel , a US citizen of Franco-German origin who bought land in the Key West neighborhood at the beginning of the 20th century. There he started a business of raw material and foundry and gave work to a large black and Chinese population. He even built houses for them to live. This fact reminded the place with the name of Callejón de Hamel, which was even on the verge of disappearing in 1913, when the neocolonial government tried to buy the land.</p>
