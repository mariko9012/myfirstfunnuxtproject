### Things to do, places/project to check out

- I love [The ReBuilding Center](https://www.rebuildingcenter.org/) is Portland nonprofit organization, closely working with local communities through creative reuse of reclaimed materials - Similar concept with Austin's [Creative Reuse](https://www.travelingcircusofurbanism.com/austin/CreativeReuse)

- [Alberta Main Street](http://albertamainst.org/shoplocal/visit/) has a unique [history](http://albertamainst.org/about/history/) and seems to have some very active community associations. It would be very interesting to join some of the [events](http://albertamainst.org/calendar/) by Neighborhood Association.

- Portland is a cycle capital in the United States and no one should leave the city without experiencing biking. [BikeTown](https://www.biketownpdx.com/) is a great sharing bike service and [EVERYBODY'S BIKE RENTALS & TOURS](http://www.pdxbikerentals.com/small-businessportland/) is the one I got reccomended by a trustworthy local. Join the occasional [Sunday Parkways](https://www.travelingcircusofurbanism.com/portland/Sundayparkways) to bike around the city without being interrupted by cars!

- [Mcmenamins](https://www.mcmenamins.com/) is a great example in the field of adaptive reuse and the company has variety of beautiful buildings that you can visit, such as [Kennedy School](https://www.mcmenamins.com/kennedy-school) and [Bagdad Theater](https://www.mcmenamins.com/bagdad-theater-pub)

- [Portland Night Market](http://www.pdxnm.com/)

- [Movies in the park](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/69554) is great for summer evening - the events are completely free and you can enjoy the quality of urban life. 

### Read

- I enjoyed reading some articles recommended by one of my local friend, that explain rich history of North Williams Ave - once the vibrant heart of Portlandâ€™s Black community.
  - [Black Williams Project](http://blackwilliamsproject.com/)
  - [Portland Gentrification: The North Williams Avenue that Was -- 1956](https://www.theskanner.com/news/history/11409-portland-gentrification-the-north-williams-avenue-that-was-1956-2011-08-09)

### Organization, initiative

- I can't stop admiring this initiative: [Immigrant Story](https://theimmigrantstory.org/immigrant-story/). They are based in Portland, collecting stories from immigrants who live in the city.
