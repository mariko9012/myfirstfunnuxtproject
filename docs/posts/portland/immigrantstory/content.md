# City and migration: Interview with Sankar Raman from the Immigrant Story

During my stay in Portland, I encountered a very inspiring project called [The Immigrant Story](https://theimmigrantstory.org/), which collects stories and photographs of immigrants in order to document/archive their voices. Sankar Raman, a founder of the project and a Northwest Digital Art Photographer, believes that **"The Immigrant Story is the American Story"**.

I've been always curious about the everyday life of immigrants in cities and how they experience cities. I interviewed Mr. Sankar Raman to learn more about the project and hear what he thinks about the topic of city and migration.

### Background - rising wave of racism

***Thank you so much for the time today. First, could you tell me a little bit about the background of the project?***

**Mr. Sankar:** The first idea of the project was born during the elections in 2017. Since then, the immigrants are increasingly becoming a scapegoat - and there is a growing illusion and divisive political rhetoric that evolves 'Them versus Us'. I was not politically active and am not a political person, but I felt an urge to do something about it.

Let me tell you the real example that happened here in Portland. There was a little girl called Fatemah, she is from Iran and she was supposed to come to Oregon health and science university to go through her heart surgery. She and her family came through Iran to Dubai and were on the way to here in Portland - and it was exactly the time the Muslim ban went into effect. She could not travel to Portland because of the ban.

It became a big issue here - everybody was protesting. And it was when I realized that it is not just political rhetoric, but real people are getting affected here in the real life in Portland.

### Creating the counter-narratives

**Mr. Sankar:** I am not a storyteller but I decided to start producing a **counter-narrative** against the dominant political rhetoric - that is all about portraying the immigrant as murderers, the rapists from shithole countries.

When you really look at the history of this country, everybody here is a migrant - they came from somewhere else. Some of us came recently, some of us came years ago, some of us came in Mayflower, some of us came 10 thousand years ago. The fact remains that the country is built on the people who come here from the outside, and it is rightfully called a nation of migration.

***I agree***

So how do we create change? I thought the way to do this is making the human connection by telling the real stories of immigrants. We also do some gallery exhibition with their pictures along with their stories and create conversations.

When I first started writing stories and sharing these stories, my wife was the editor, so for the first few months we did all the publishing works by ourselves. After the few trials, I was really fortunate that so many high-quality journalists joined us.

All the talented journalists form a local newspaper, or other big media like the Los Angeles Times and Washington post have been working for us on a voluntary basis. We have about 20 volunteers and they were talented writers, photographers, web designers, visual designers, and artists.

### The art of listening

***I've been curious why you picked storytelling as your methodology to tackle the challenge. So it is about the human connection, creating empathy among people, isn't it?***

**Mr. Sankar:** Yes, exactly. I mean, when I hear about your personal story, for instance, there's no way I can hate you, right?

We spend about 2 hours with each interviewee about their life -  where the person was born, what the person does, how was the life before coming to U.S. etc. We also spend a lot of time and energy in revising the story so that it comes out really authentic.

***How do you find these people to interview with?***

**Mr. Sankar:** I really enjoy meeting people - and whenever I meet people I am always curious about the stories behind them. When they have an interesting story to tell I write it down and ask them if they want to be part of this project to share their stories.

That is my main way of finding people to interview, and I am very curious to gather all these stories of diaspora, refugees, conflicts. These are very important stories to be documented.

### Urban narratives and immigrant's relationship with cities

***I am curious about the relationship between the city of Portland and the Immigrant Story. How does the city affect your idea?***

**Mr.Sankar:** Portland is a very progressive city. However, it still acts like a white city, and we still have problems.

For instance, in this part of town (Northwest), most of them are tech workers like me, working with Nike and Intel etc., and people are very diverse. This diversity, for some reason for me, I could navigate through that. I do not see any issues racially from my experience.

However, when I started this project, I started going to the other part of the city such as Southeast Portland. Different parts of the city have its own different cultural mix. There I see different elements of racial undercurrent at play at different levels.

For example, about a year ago, there was a stabbing incident in the MAX Train and two people were stabbed to death here in Portland. This kind of thing happens in Portland.

***I'm always curious about how immigrants experience the city, how they move here and interact with other communities, and how they experience discrimination and challenges. That's why it's really important to listen to personal stories, because they can only be truly understood by personal experiences.***

**Mr.Sankar:** Exactly. Right now, we have an exhibition hat is been shown at [the Oregon Jewish Museum](http://www.ojmche.org/) in downtown. We call it “Who We Are.” We interviewed six women who were affected by the MAX Incident over a period of one year.

It highlights the immigrant experience - what happened to this community, how the community was feeling at that time. You can see how their emotions, the intensity of emotions, their feelings from the exhibition. Through their personal expereinces, we explore race, identity, and culture.

### Place to celebrate diversity

***What is your next step?***

**Mr. Sankar:** I have a big vision.

There are museums for the Vietnam war, the second world war, etc.. but there is no museum for the achievements of immigration.

My goal is to create a museum that explores the immigration and their achievements. Just imagine a museum that has a floor that talks about Irish immigrants, another floor about Eastern European immigrants, etc.

These are all different people who come from different continents. Nobody was here 10,000 years ago, and we should talk about all their accomplishment.

I want to have a place where we celebrate it. I think it's important to have an actual place where you can bring people in and explore.

### We all travel

***I like the term "immigrants" when you use it. It implies to everyone - it's not only people in color.***

**Mr. Sankar:** Yeah, everybody! Basically, we are all immigrants.

Let me tell you one story of myself, which is very personal to me. I came from a very small village in India - a very small community and nobody knows how long our community has been there.

But then when I do my DNA, it says I traveled through the spice route -  meaning that I came from somewhere in the Middle East, and they have traveled over the years through that spice route to the Indian and of Afghanistan, Iran through Pakistan through India and then care down to South of India.

My point is that the path my ancestors took is a true way to understand human beings. Humans travel and not only humans but also cultures, languages, food etc.

***I agree. I can't wait to see a place that celebrates diversity and migration. Than you so much for the time today!***
