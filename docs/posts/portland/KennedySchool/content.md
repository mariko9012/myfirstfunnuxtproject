### McMenamins, a pioneer in the adaptive reuse field

Started in 1974 by the McMenamins brothers, the Oregon-based company [McMenamins](https://www.mcmenamins.com/) has been reusing old buildings that once served as schools, churches, theaters and homes.Their properties include historic hotels, pubs, concert venues and movie theaters, and all of them are whimsical and wonderfully special.

They recognized the local values and potentials of these abandoned buildings, as well as the environmental responsibility in restoring old buildings - they also use recycled materials wherever possible in new construction. Thus, McMenamins is a great example for adaptive reuse, adding new vales to the old buildings for the future while paying respect to their histories.

The other day, I visited one of their venues in Portland called [Kennedy School](https://www.mcmenamins.com/kennedy-school) - which includes hotels, pubs, an event venue and a swimming pool, dining and movie theater.

### Kennedy School

The Kennedy School, a historic elementary school in northeast Portland that opened in 1915, has been transformed into a 57-room hotel with a restaurant, multiple small bars, a movie theater, a soaking pool and a brewery. There is more than 8,500 square feet of meeting space, including the 3,400-square-foot Gymnasium and 600-square-foot Agnes Kennedy White Library.
