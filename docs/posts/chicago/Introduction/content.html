<p>It's been said that Chicago's Neighborhood Parks is one of <a href="https://interactive.wttw.com/ten/parks/chicagos-neighborhood-parks" target="_blank" class="external">the 10 parks that changed America</a>. In the late 19C, the two designers <a href="http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> and Calvert Vaux executed that vision in a system of smaller neighborhood parks that serve better for immigrants and working-class people in Chicago.</p>

<p>Downtown Chicago is beautiful - but once you take the stairs to go down to the ground, you see the completely different landscape of <a href="https://www.chicagodetours.com/exploring-underground-chicago-layers/" target="_blank" class="external">underground space</a> of the city. There are hidden restaurants and bars &amp; clubs, and it's quite fun for urban adventurers.</p>

<p>It's quite interesting to learn how Chicago sold one of its skyways to the private sector. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5TFhucZ-R4" target="_blank" class="external">Chicago sold the Chicago Skyway for $1.8 billion</a></p>
