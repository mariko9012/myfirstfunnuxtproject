<p>Homelessness is one of the serious issues that all cities can relate to. Since 2008, <a href="https://www.pathwithart.org/">Path with Art</a> has been working to transform the lives of people recovering from homelessness, addiction, and other trauma by the power of art and creative engagement. I visited one of their exhibitions <a href="https://www.pathwithart.org/pearl-jam-collaboration">Unpacking Homelessness: A PATH WITH ART &amp; PEARL JAM COLLABORATION</a> during my stay there, and saw the posters that are designed by the artists who experiences homelessness. All the staffs there are so kind and warm - I highly recommend to visit there and have conversation with them.</p>
