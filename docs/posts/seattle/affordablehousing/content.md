Seattle is changing and growing increasingly unaffordable for working class people. One solution is to build more public and non-profit owner affordable housing to provide options for lower income residents at risk of being displaced. Seattle has been investing in affordable housing for many years and has a lot of wonderful projects built and in the works. Join The Urbanist and others as we learn about some these great community based affordable housing projects along the Link light rail line in South Seattle.

The other day I participated one of the Urbanist's events about [Housing Community in South Seattle](https://www.theurbanist.org/2018/08/07/building-community-in-southeast-seattle-tour-this-saturday/)

1. Plaza Roberto Maestas

Miguel Maestas, the current housing and economic development director of El Centro de la Raza, explains that his organization decided to build Plaza Roberto Maestas when, in 2003, it learned that Sound Transit had plans to construct a light rail station on a vacant plot of land across the street from its historic building. The plot on which the subway station would rise is where the South China Restaurant on Beacon Avenue used to be. It had the most diverse bar in the city. The spirit of the Four Amigos has always been strong in this part of town. The transit-oriented project cost $45 million, was designed by the local architecture firm SMR Architects, has 112 rental units for people making from 30 to 80 percent of the area median income (which means if you earn 30 percent of the median income, you pay about $465 for a one-bedroom apartmentâ€”a market-rate studio apartment on Beacon Hill costs around $900 to $1,000). On the first day the apartments were made available to the public, more than 1,000 people applied. The 112 units were filled almost immediately. The waiting list is as good as eternal. Maestas calls the situation heartbreaking. There is nearly not enough affordable housing in this city.

3. Othello Square

[Othello Square](https://homesightwa.org/community-development/real-estate-development/othellosquare) (formerly the Southeast Economic Opportunity Center) will be a culturally relevant and welcoming place where people in Southeast Seattle and beyond can access opportunities for higher education, good paying jobs, and support to start and keep a business. Integrating shared space for cultural organizations and workforce housing will help stabilize communities at risk of displacement and engage diverse residents.


HomeSight plans to develop 265 apartments and for-sale homes, affordable retail and commercial space and community support services.




We will use the light rail to travel the Rainier Valley learning about El Centro de la Raza's Plaza Roberto Maestas - a truly mixed use community next to the Beacon Hill Light rail station that includes affordable housing, retail, childcare, social program and public open space. We will then travel via light rail to explore another TBD project before continuing on to the Othello Station to learn about the proposed Othello Square project. This catalytic community project will incorporate affordable rental and ownership housing, a multi cultural community center, low income medical clinic, childcare, economic development offices, affordable commercial space, and a charter high school.
