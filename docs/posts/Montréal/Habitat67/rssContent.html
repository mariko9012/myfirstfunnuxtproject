The other pavilion to live on is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/13/habitat-67-montreal-expo-moshe-safdie-history-cities-50-buildings-day-35">Habitat 67</a> – the young Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie’s wildly ambitious, government-sponsored attempt at reimagining apartment living, and one of the most important buildings of the 1960s.</p>
<p>You simply can't leave Montréal without checking out Habitat 67. This famous apartment buildings of the 1960s were designed by the Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie for Montréal’s world Expo in 1967.</p>
<h3>A functioning icon of 1960s utopianism</h3>

<p>Habitat 67 echoes a little known post-war Japanese architectural movement called Metabolism, whose proponents believed buildings should be designed as living, organic, interconnected webs of prefabricated cells.</p>

<p>Bjarke Ingels of <a href="http://www.big.dk/">BIG</a>, who thinks Habitat ’67 is “jaw dropping.” For a site in downtown Toronto, BIG has proposed a collection of rectilinear units arranged in jagged stacks, grouped around interior courtyards. The project, which is currently wending its way through the city’s approval process, is clad in stone instead of concrete, and it certainly won’t be prefabricated, but the family resemblance is obvious. Ingels has referred to this development as “Habitat 2.0.”</p>

<em>A model of Habitat 2.0 is being exbited at <a href="http://unzippedtoronto.com/">Unzipped Toronto</a>, Bjarke Ingels’s Serpentine Pavilion, at Kings Street in Toronto.</em></p>
<p>Proposed for a site between King Street West and Wellington Street, the BIG-designed development includes 500 apartments contained within a pixelated-looking block that rises and falls to create five peaks.</p>
<p>It is this modular arrangement that gives the design a similar aesthetic to Safdie's Habitat 67 – the three-dimensional landscape of 354 stacked concrete &quot;boxes&quot; built for the Montreal Expo of 1967.</p>
<p>But the building mass will be broken up into cuboidal modules, each twisted by 45 degrees to create more opportunities to bring in daylight.<br>
The five tower elements will each be between 15 and 17 storeys high. There will also be openings at ground level, allowing pedestrians to potentially walk through the courtyard.</p>
