Their community on the eastern side of the Kamo river, and severe discrimination and ostracism in the 60s was famously portrayed in the Japanese movie \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.imdb.com\u002Ftitle\u002Ftt0449630\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\"\u003EPachiggi\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.

It is a multipurpose art facility that has hotel, hostels, galleries, and artists in residences in one building, and the neighborhood is full of local businesses that support Kyoto's food culture. Compared to now hyper touristic Nishiki Market, this market and a whole neighborhood still holds a sense of authenticity and localness.
