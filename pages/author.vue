      <p>
        Hi! I'm Mariko, a city enthusiast currently traveling around the world.
        I'm a researcher, editor and writer on the urban issues, and I have been involved in the various international urban programs and initiatives all over the world.

        <strong>
          As an Urbanist,
        </strong>
        I'm most passionate about our cities. I’ve involved in many international educational projects like <a href="http://www.4cities.eu/" target="_blank">4CITIES</a>, <a href="https://www.urbandivercities.eu/" target="_blank">DIVERCITIES</a>, and have visited more than 120 organizations and 50 cities accross the globe for research. More specifically I’m interested in ethno-cultural diversity in our cities, and the notion of nationality and sense of belonging.
