          <strong>
            As an Urbanist,
          </strong>
          I'm most passionate about our cities. I’ve involved in many international educational projects like <a href="http://www.4cities.eu/" target="_blank">4CITIES</a>, <a href="https://www.urbandivercities.eu/" target="_blank">DIVERCITIES</a>, visited more than 120 organizations and 30 cities. More specifically I’m interested in ethno-cultural diversity in our cities, and the notion of nationality and sense of belonging.

          <strong>
            As a project manager,
          </strong>
          Having worked in a design firm <a href="https://loftwork.com/en/" target="_blank">Loftwork</a> as a director and marketer, I organize various events and workshops in collaboration with the international organizations, such as 2 days workshop <a href="https://medium.com/digitalsocietyschool/global-goals-jam-2017-tokyo-6141f938b7d3" target="_blank">Global Goals Jam</a> and <a href="https://loftwork.com/jp/event/20170829_sgs_report" target="_blank">Social Good Summit Tokyo</a>, or more urbanism related events like <a href="https://medium.com/@mariko9012/subjective-map-workshop-shibuya-712e92d21051" target="_blank">subjective map workshop</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@mariko9012/urbanist-meetup-tokyo-examining-the-role-of-urbanists-in-improving-urban-life-in-tokyo-df2e5bdea51a" target="_blank">urbanist meetup</a>.

          I'm a huge traveler – I’ve lived in ten different cities, in seven different countries. I’m always passionate about making my homes everywhere in the world!
